| -------------------------------------------------------------------- |

We are proud to offer a beta AI feature that helps you to get started on an App. This feature is still in development and we are working hard to improve it.

You must enter a detailed prompt in order for the feature to work. It can take between 30 seconds and 1 minute to generate an App.

:::warning
The AI feature is still in development and may not work as expected. There is a good chance that there is an error while creating or editing your app.

### Editing using AI

You can also edit your app using AI. While editing your app, you can click the ![brain](/docs/getting-started/ai_edit_btn.png) icon button. This will open a dialog where you can enter a detailed prompt.

![edit using ai](/docs/getting-started/edit_using_ai_prompt.png)

Please enter a detailed prompt and click 'Submit'. It can take between 30 seconds a 1 minute to generate an App.

:::warning
This could drastically change your app. The AI model often makes mistakes. Please check your app carefully before REFRESHING or EXITING the page.
If there are any errors you can revert back to the previous version of your app using the "Undo The Last Edit" button.
:::

#### Undoing the last edit

After editing your app using AI, you can undo all the changes that were made. This will revert your app back to a state before it was last edited with AI. All changes you made since then will be
deleted!
