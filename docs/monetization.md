# App Monetization

MecSimCalc allows you as the app developer to monetize your app by charging users a monthly subscription for access to your app. You can get started for free by following the steps below.

MecSimCalc uses the [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) payment platform to handle all payments. Stripe is a secure and well trusted payment platform used by many companies around the world. MecSimCalc does not store any payment information on our servers and does not have access to any payment, bank, or credit card information.

## Eligibility

You are eligible to monetize your app if you meet the following requirements:

1. Have a free MecSimCalc account
2. Reside in a country supported by Stripe (see [here](https://stripe.com/global) for supported countries)
3. At least 13 years old
4. Have a valid bank account to receive payouts
