# App Monetization

MecSimCalc allows you, as the app developer, to monetize your app by charging users a monthly subscription for access to your app. You can get started for free by following the steps below.

#### About Stripe

MecSimCalc uses [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) to handle all payments. Stripe is a secure and well trusted payment platform used by many companies around the world. MecSimCalc does not retain any payment data on our servers and cannot access any payment, banking, or credit card details.

## Eligibility

You are eligible to monetize your app if you:

1. Have a free MecSimCalc account.
2. Reside in a country supported by Stripe, found [here](https://stripe.com/global).
3. Are at least 13 years old.
4. Have a valid bank account to receive payouts.
5. Have verification documents, if you are an individual or incorporated documents, if you are a business.

## Step 1: Onboarding

In order to receive payouts, you must first complete the Stripe onboarding by going to https://mecsimcalc.com/account#edit-monetization, and then clicking on **Get Started** under the _Edit Monetization_ section.

</div>

Once redirected, create a Stripe account and complete the onboarding process. You will be asked to provide information about your individual or business and bank account details. This information is required by Stripe to verify your identity and to send you payouts.

:::caution
Your Stripe account login is different from your MecSimCalc account login. Make sure to save your Stripe login details!

Once onboarding is complete, you will be redirected to your Stripe dashboard (more about that below).
Your [Edit Monetization](https://mecsimcalc.com/account#edit-monetization) section should now look like this:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

</div>

## Step 2: Set a price

Next, set a price for each app that you want to monetize. Users will be charged a _monthly subscription fee_ to access your app.

Go to the Info step of your app's editor. Find the **Monthly subscription fee (optional)** field and enter a price in USD
of at least $0.99. Then publish your app to enable the subscription.

You can change the price at any time by editing the price field on the Info step and republishing your app. Existing users will continue to be charged at the old price until they cancel their subscription, even when the price is lowered. New users will be charged at the new price.

All existing subscription will be cancelled immediately if:

- The price of a paid app is changed to $0 (i.e. free)
- The app is unpublished
- The app is deleted

:::tip
This subscription fee does not apply to you as the app developer. You will not be charged a subscription fee to access your own apps.

### Coupons

After setting a price, you can optionally create coupons to give users a discount on their monthly subscription(s). Coupons can be created by clicking on the **Coupons** button next to the Price field.

There are 3 types of coupons:

| Type      | Description                                                                                                                                              | Example                     |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Once      | Applies to the first charge from a subscription with this coupon applied.                                                                                | 50% off the 1st month.      |
| Repeating | Applies to charges in the first `duration_in_months` months from a subscription with this coupon applied. Where `duration_in_months` is a numeric field. | 50% off the first 5 months. |
| Forever   | Applies to all charges from a subscription with this coupon applied.                                                                                     | 50% off forever.            |

There are 2 optional restrictions that can be applied to coupons:

| Restriction     | Description                                                                                                                        | Example                         |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Redeem by       | The last time at which the coupon can be redeemed. After the redeem_by date, the coupon can no longer be applied to new customers. | Redeem by Dec 31 at 11:59pm.    |
| Max redemptions | The number of times the coupon can be redeemed before itâ€™s no longer valid.                                                        | 50% off for the first 20 users. |

### Fees

Note that a portion of each subscription will be subtracted in fees to cover transaction fees, currency conversions, and various platform costs. The remaining amount will be paid out to you, in other words, the fees are included in the app price. The fee percentage is as follows:

| Price (USD)   | Fee (%) |
| ------------- | ------- |
| $0.99 - $1.99 | 50%     |
| $2.00+        | 30%     |

## Step 3: Stripe Dashboard
