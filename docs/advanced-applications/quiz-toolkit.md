# Quiz Toolkit

| :trophy: This is a [premium](https://mecsimcalc.com/pricing) feature |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- |


**MecSimCalc** supports online quizzes. We can **randomize** the given values in question, collect quiz results when student run Mecsimcalc App, and send them to your [**Google Spreadsheet**](https://www.google.ca/sheets/about/) or [**send email notification**](https://www.google.com/gmail/about/). We also support integration with [**Canvas**](https://canvas.instructure.com/) to collect quiz grades.


## Create the Quiz App
In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a quiz app using **MecSimCalc** with different types of questions.
### Numerical Question
For example, you can create a quiz app that asks students to solve a math problem and input their answer. The app will then compare the student's answer with the correct answer and grade it.

#### 1) Create a NumberInput for Student to Input Answer
Follow the steps below to create a `NumberInput` as a variable in question and for students to input their answer:
![img alt](/docs/advanced-applications/quiz-toolkit/numerical_ex.png)

#### 2) How to randomize variables in question
Click the **Blue Edit button** to edit the `NumberInput`, click the **ADVANCED** menu, select **Randomize Input**. 
After you set up the **Step**, **Min** and **Max** for the `NumberInput`, the value will be randomized everytime when the student runs the app.
![img alt](/docs/advanced-applications/quiz-toolkit/numerical_ex2.png)

#### 3) Python Code for Compare Answer and Grade it
You can implement the logic to calculate the correct answer in the Python code. Click [here](../code/overview) to find out how to write Python code in MecSimCalc.

### Algebraic Question
Mecsimcalc allows you to **verify if two algebraic expressions are mathematically equivalent**.
All you need to do is to **install [`sympy`](https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html) library**. Click [here](../code/environments#step-2-add-python-packages) to see how to install Python packages in your environment

For example, assume that you want to compare if two expressions are the same or not, checkout this example:
<div style={{width: "100%", height: "600px", overflow: "hidden"}}><iframe src="https://mecsimcalc.com/app/8080021/algebraic_expression_comparison_demo" width="100%" height="100%" title="MecSimCalc" style={{position:"relative", left:"-45px", top:"-48px"}} frameBorder="0"></iframe></div>


#### 1) Create a TextInput for Student to Input Answer
Follow the same steps before, creating a `NumberInput` for students to input their answer:
![img alt](/docs/advanced-applications/quiz-toolkit/algebraic_ex.png)
The algebraic expression input will be saved as a `str` type. For example, you can input `x^2 + 2*x + 1` as the algebraic expression.

#### 2) How to compare two algebraic expressions
Here we demonstrate the code of above example. You can use the function below:
```python
import sympy as sp

def check_expressions_equal(expr1_str, expr2_str):

   # Convert the string representations to SymPy expressions
   expr1 = sp.sympify(expr1_str)
   expr2 = sp.sympify(expr2_str)

   # Simplify the difference between the two expressions# and check if the result is equal to zero
   # If the result is zero, the expressions are equal, otherwise they are not
   return sp.simplify(expr1 - expr2) == 0, expr1, expr2

```
And below is the main code part:
```python
def main(inputs):
   expr1=inputs['func_1']
   expr2=inputs['func_2']

   res, expr1, expr2 = check_expressions_equal(expr1,expr2)
   
   # convert to latex expression
   latex_expr1 = sp.latex(expr1)
   latex_expr2 = sp.latex(expr2)

   return {"result": res, "String1": latex_expr1, "String2": latex_expr2}
```
#### 3) Displaying Results
Below is the **Output** code of above example to display the results in `LaTex` format:

```text
{% if outputs.result %}
These two equations are the same
{% else %}
These two equations are not the same
{% endif %}

Equation 1: {{ outputs.String1 | katex}}
Equation 2: {{ outputs.String2 | katex}}
```
Click [here](../output/latex) for more information about writing `LaTex` in your output.


## Retrieving Quiz Results
In this section, we will show you how to retrieve quiz results and send them to your **Google Spreadsheet**, **Gmail** and **Canvas**.
### Export Results to Google Sheets
MecSimCalc has its own function that can be used. Users can append data to their own Google Sheets by calling [`append_to_google_sheet`](../mecsimcalc-library#append_to_google_sheet).
Check out the [example](#google-spreadsheet-example) first to see what the result will look like in the Google Sheet.

#### Arguments:

| Argument               | Type     | Description                                                                                                                   |
|------------------------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **`service_account_info`** | **dict** | The credentials used for Google Sheets API authentication.                                                                    |
| **`spreadsheet_id`**       | **str**  | The unique identifier of your Google Spreadsheet.                                                                             |
| **`values`**               | **list of lists** | The data to append. Each list element represents a row of data.                                                               |
| **`range_name`**           | **str** (optional)  | The A1 notation of the range to start appending data (Defaults to 'Sheet1!A1'). Generally, there is no need to make changes.. |
| **`include_timestamp`**    | **bool** (optional) | If True, appends the current timestamp to each row of data (Defaults to True).                                                |

:::tip

**Learn how to get [`spreadsheet_id`](#how-to-get-spreadsheet-id), [`service account info`](#how-to-get-service-account-info)!**

:::

All you need to do is add:
```python
values = [
    [ inputs['name'], inputs['id'], grade ],
]  
    
msc.append_to_google_sheet(service_account_info, spreadsheet_id, values)

# if you don't want to include timestamp
msc.append_to_google_sheet(service_account_info, spreadsheet_id, values, 
include_timestamp=False)
```

Quiz values will append to your Google Sheet:
![img alt](/docs/advanced-applications/quiz-toolkit/sheet_ex.png)

#### How to Get Spreadsheet ID
You need to create a Spreadsheet first.
The Spreadsheet ID is **the last string of characters in the URL for your spreadsheet**.

For example, in the URL https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qpyC0XzvTcKT6wQoFDE8p-Bll4hps/edit#gid=0 , the spreadsheet ID is **1qpyC0XzvTcKT6wQoFDE8p-Bll4hps**

#### How to Get Service Account Info

##### Step 1: Enable the Google Sheets API

Before integrating Google APIs into your project, you must enable them within a Google Cloud project. This process allows you to activate one or multiple APIs under the same project umbrella.

1. **First**, navigate to the Google Cloud Console and activate the Google Sheets API through the following link: [Enable the Google Sheets API](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=sheets.googleapis.com).

   ![img alt](/docs/advanced-applications/quiz-toolkit/sheet_step_1.png)

2. **Next**, you'll need to create a Google Cloud Project if you haven't done so already. Detailed instructions can be found here: [Create a Google Cloud Project](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-project).

   ![img alt](/docs/advanced-applications/quiz-toolkit/sheet_step_2.png)

##### Step 2: [Create Service Account](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials#create_credentials_for_a_service_account) Credentials

To authenticate your application with Google's APIs, follow these steps to create and obtain service account credentials:

1. In the Google Cloud console, go to Menu  > **IAM & Admin** > **Service Accounts**.

   [Go to Service Accounts](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts)

2. **Choose your service account**. If you don't have one, create a new service account and assign it the Editor role for adequate permissions.

   ![img alt](/docs/advanced-applications/quiz-toolkit/sheet_step_3.png)
3. Navigate to **Keys** > **Add Key** > **Create New Key**, and select the **JSON** option. Upon clicking **Create**, a JSON file containing your new key pair will be downloaded.

   ![img alt](/docs/advanced-applications/quiz-toolkit/sheet_step_4.png)
4. **Save the JSON file** as **`credentials.json`** in your project directory. This file contains your service account's credentials, which you'll use to authenticate your application. Here's what the JSON file looks like:


```json
{
  "type": "service_account",
  "project_id": "your-project-id",
  "private_key_id": "private_key_id",
  "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----…-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
  "client_email": "your-service-account-email",
  "client_id": "your-client-id",
  "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
  "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
  "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
  "client_x509_cert_url": "your-client-x509-cert-url"
}
```

The contents of `credentials.json` will be used as the `service_account_info` parameter. Simply copy this information and pass it to the `append_to_sheet()` function as the `service_account_info` argument.


### Email Results to Student/Instructor

You can use [`send_gmail`](../mecsimcalc-library#send_gmail) function.
#### Arguments:

| Argument            | Type     | Description                                                                |
|---------------------|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **`sender_email`**      | **str**  | The email address of the sender.                                           |
| **`receiver_email`**    | **str**  | The email address of the receiver.                                         |
| **`subject`**           | **str**  | The subject line of the email.                                             |
| **`app_password`**      | **str**  | The app-specific password for the sender's email account.                  |
| **`values`**            | **list** | A list of lists. Each list contains data to be included in the email body. |

:::tip
**Learn how to get an [`app_password`](#31-how-to-create-a-google-app-password)!**
:::

For example, you can retrieve the student's `name` and `id` from the input, calculate the `grade` through code, and this information can be sent to the receiver's email. All you need to do is add :
```python
values = [
        ["Joe", "186234", 85]
]
msc.send_email(sender_email = "sender_email@gmail.com", 
               receiver_email = "receiver_email@example.ca", 
               subject = "Quiz Results", 
               app_password = "xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx", 
               values = values)
```
Then receiver will get an email like this:

![img alt](/docs/advanced-applications/quiz-toolkit/gmail_ex.png)


#### How to Create a Google App Password

Official Google support page: [Create & use App Passwords](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en).

An app password is a 16-digit code that allows less secure apps or devices to access your Google Account. This is especially useful if you have 2-Step Verification enabled and the app you're using doesn't support "Sign in with Google." Here’s how to create one:

1. Go to your [Google Account](https://myaccount.google.com/).
2. Select **Security.**
3. Under "Signing in to Google," select **2-Step Verification**.
   ![img alt](/docs/advanced-applications/quiz-toolkit/gmail_step_1.png)
4. At the bottom of the page, select **App passwords**.
5. Enter a name that helps you remember where you’ll use the app password.
6. Click **Generate** to obtain the 16-digit app password.
7. **Make sure to save the app password** (as you won't be able to see it later) and then copy it into your quiz app


### Integration with Canvas Gradebook (Beta)

:::warning
**We are still working on this feature, and it is currently in beta.**
:::
**Mecsimcalc** integrates with [**Canvas**](https://canvas.instructure.com/), enabling professors to collect quiz grades.

#### 1) Create Essay Questions on Canvas
You need to create a quiz on Canvas that only have `Essay Question`, which only use to collect grades:
![img alt](/docs/advanced-applications/quiz-toolkit/canvas_ex2.png)
We support user to create multiple question in Canvas, and the length of `grade` list should be equal to the number of questions.
After you run the code above, you will see following result:
![img alt](/docs/advanced-applications/quiz-toolkit/canvas_ex.png)

You can use `submit_canvas_quiz` function.
#### Arguments:

| Argument          | Type                | Description                                                         |

| `teacher_token`   | **str**             | Authorization token for the teacher.                                |
| `student_token`   | **str**             | Authorization token for the student.                                |
| `course_id`       | **str**             | The ID of the course containing the quiz.                           |
| `quiz_id`         | **str**             | The ID of the quiz to be submitted.                                 |
| `grades`          | **list of str**     | A list of grades/answers to submit for the quiz.                    |
| `multiple_attempts`  | **bool** (optional) | Whether to allow multiple attempts for the quiz. (Default to False) |

#### Returns:

| Return Type             | Description                                        |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **`dict`**              | A dictionary containing the response from the final quiz submission completion request. |


```python
# You should get student token from `inputs`
student_token = inputs['student_token']

teacher_token = 'teacher_token'
course_id = 'course_id'
quiz_id = 'quiz_id'
grades = ["100", "90"] # Assume you already calculate the grade for two questions

# Execute the function
msc.submit_canvas_quiz(teacher_token, student_token, course_id, quiz_id, grades, multiple_attempts=False)
```

#### 2) For Students to Complete the Quiz
You need to generate a `student_token` as the Quiz input access token.
##### How to get student token
After sign in your Canvas account, click **Account/Settings** ([link](https://canvas.instructure.com/profile/settings))
![img alt](/docs/advanced-applications/quiz-toolkit/canvas_token.png)

For student: this is the `student_token` you need to submit Mecsimcalc-Canvas quiz
For professor: this is the `teacher_token` you need to set up when you create the quiz app.
:::danger
**Do NOT leak your Token to others!!!**
:::
#### 3) For Professors to Set Up the Quiz
You need to find `teacher_token`, `course_id`, `quiz_id`


##### How to get teacher token
Follow the same steps as [above](#how-to-get-student-token), and you will find your `teacher_token` in the same place as `student_token`.


##### How to get course and quiz id
You can find both of them from the URL.
For example, if the URL looks like: https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/123/quizzes/456, then `course_id` will be `123`, `quiz_id` will be `456`


## How to Embed the Quiz into Your Website
You can embed your quiz into your website using an `iframe` tag, just like the [`Example`](#example) part in this docs.
### Find the Quiz URL
Copy the URL of your quiz from the address bar of your browser. For example: `https://mecsimcalc.com/app/6170581/thevenin_equivalent_circuit_calculator`
### Add HTML Code to Your Website
Replace `your_quiz_url` with the URL of your quiz.
```html
<div style={{width: "100%", height: "600px", overflow: "hidden"}}><iframe src="your_quiz_url" width="100%" height="100%" title="MecSimCalc" style={{position:"relative", left:"-45px", top:"-48px"}} frameBorder="0"></iframe></div>

```
## Example

Below showcases an app that collects quiz results and append them to a Google Spreadsheet.
<div style={{width: "100%", height: "600px", overflow: "hidden"}}><iframe src="https://mecsimcalc.com/app/0554567/test_quiz_demo_google_sheet" width="100%" height="100%" title="MecSimCalc" style={{position:"relative", left:"-45px", top:"-48px"}} frameBorder="0"></iframe></div>

As you can see, the results from the app above will **append** to the sheet. (We make delete previous result each time only for demonstration)
<iframe src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XX2gWauVwkACsIWUiF7cIpIlrL1eOjS3_Ub30tqet5o/edit?usp=sharing" style={{
width: '100%',
height: '400px',
border: '0',
}}
frameborder="0">
</iframe>

For example, you can get student's `name` and `id` from the input, and calculate `grade` through code. If you want this information to be exported to your own **Google Sheet** and **email**, you can do it like this:
```python
"""
Assume that inputs['name'] = "Joe", inputs['id'] = "186234", inputs['grade'] = 85
"""
import mecsimcalc as msc

def main(inputs):
    grade = ... #your logic here
    
    #values you want to collect
    values = [
    [ inputs['name'], inputs['id'], grade ],
    ]    

    # For Google Sheet:
    service_account_info = {
        # We will teach you how to get this later, don't worry
    }
    spreadsheet_id = 'your_spreadsheet_id_here'
  
    msc.append_to_google_sheet(service_account_info, spreadsheet_id, values)

    
    # For Gmail:
    sender_email = 'sender@example.com'
    receiver_email = 'receiver@example.com'
    subject = 'Quiz Results'
    app_password = 'your_app_password_here'
    
    msc.send_gmail(sender_email, receiver_email, subject, app_password, values)
    ...
```
The output will be like this:
