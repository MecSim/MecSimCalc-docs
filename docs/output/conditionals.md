# Conditionals

The **Outputs** editor is built upon **Jinja**, a templating engine for Python. Jinja operations can easily be identified with having `{{ }}` or `{% %}`. To learn more about templating visit the Jinja docs [here](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/templates/) or the Nunjucks docs [here](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/templating.html).

## If Statement

```python
{% if test1 %}
# output if test1 is true
{% elif test2 %}
# output if test2 is true
{% else test2 %}
# output if all previous tests  are false
{%  endif %}
```

### Example

In this [_**app**_](https://mecsimcalc.com/app/9164993/pressure_design_of_pipeline_according_to_csa_z_662), the CSA Z662.19 design equations are used to calculate the design pressure of a pipe. The _**app**_ then compares the design pressure with the operating pressure and the `if` condition is used in the output to indicate whether the pipe is safe or unsafe.

<div style={{width: "100%", height: "700px", overflow: "hidden"}}>
<iframe src='https://mecsimcalc.com/app/9164993/pressure_design_of_pipeline_according_to_csa_z_662' style={{position:"relative", left:"-45px", top:"-48px"}} width="100%" height="700" title="MecSimCalc" frameBorder="0"></iframe>
</div>

Seven inputs are used:

- Four are [**Numerical Inputs**](../inputs/input-types): the Diameter `d`, the Wall Thickness `t`, the Grade `sy`, and the Operating Pressure `p`.
- Three are [**Single Select**](../inputs/input-types): the Location Factor `l`, the Temperature Factor `tf`, and the Joint Factor `j`.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

</div>

The code for this app is given below:

```python
def main(inputs):
    d = inputs['d'] # Diameter
    t = inputs['t'] # Wall Thickness
    sy = inputs['sy'] # Grade
    p = inputs['p'] # Operating Pressure
    lf = inputs['l'] # Location Factor
    jf = inputs['j'] # Joint Factor
    tf = inputs['tf'] # Temperature Factor

    # location converted to a number
    ldic = {"1.0":1.0, "0.9":0.90, "0.8":0.80, "0.75":0.75, "0.7":0.7, "0.625":0.625, "0.55":0.55, "0.5":0.5 }
    lf = dict[lf]

    # joint factor converted to a number
    jdic = {"Seamless (1.00)":1.0, "Electric Welded (1.00)":1.0, "Submerged arc welded (1.00)":1.0, "Continuous welded (0.60)":0.6}
    jf = jdic[jf]

    # temperature factor converted to a number
    tdic = {"Up to 120 (1.00)": 1.0, "150 (0.97)":0.97, "180 (0.93)":0.93, "200 (0.91)":0.91, "230 (0.87)":0.87}
    tf = tdic[tf]

    # calculating the design pressure
    dp = 2*sy*t/d*0.8*lf*jf*tf
    dp = round(dp,2)

    return {"Operating Pressure": p, "Design Pressure":dp}
```

Notice how the **Single Select** variables, which are strings are treated differently from the **Numerical Inputs**. A dictionary is used to find the factors corresponding to the options selected by the _**user**_. The code returns a dictionary with two keys: `Operating Pressure` and `Design Pressure`.

The `if` condition compares the two variables with each other to display a different message based on this comparison. The following is the text in the **Output** editor (Notice that the output variables were used in the `if` statement without the curly brackets):

</div>

## For Statement

```python
{% for i in foo %}
# output for every i
{% endfor %}
```

### Example

In this [_**app**_](https://mecsimcalc.com/app/1535961/using_for_loop), the user inputs an integer value. The _**app**_ then outputs a table of all the numbers up to the integer value along with their squares:

<div style={{width: "100%", height: "500px", overflow: "hidden"}}>
<iframe src='https://mecsimcalc.com/app/1535961/using_for_loop' style={{position:"relative", left:"-45px", top:"-48px"}} width="100%" height="500" title="MecSimCalc" frameBorder="0"></iframe>
</div>

The _**user**_ is required to input an integer value `a`.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

![img alt](/docs/output/ex_for.png)

</div>

The code simply outputs a dictionary with one key `Count`:

```python
def main(inputs):
    a = inputs['a']
    return {"Count": a}
```

In the output editor, a condition along with the HTML table tags are used to generate a table based on the value of `Count`.

```html
<table>
  <th>Number</th>
  <th>It's square</th>

  {% for i in range(outputs.Count) %}
  <tr>
    <td>{{ i+1 }}</td>
    <td>{{ (i+1)**2 }}</td>
  </tr>
  {% endfor %}
</table>
```

Notice how the Python function `range` was used in the `for` loop and that inside the `for` loop, the output variable `outputs.Count` was used without any curly brackets. Notice as well how arithmetic operations (adding of the value of 1 and squaring the numbers) are done within two sets of curly brackets `{{ }}`.
