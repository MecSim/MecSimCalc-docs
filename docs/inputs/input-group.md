# Input Group

In order to visually organize the inputs, **MecSimCalc** platform allows the _**developer**_ to visually group inputs into either an **Input Group** or a [**Table Group**](table-group). An **Input Group** can be created in the **Inputs** step by clicking on **Add Input Group**.

</div>

:::tip
The different input types appear in the menu only if an **Input Group** or a **Table Group** has already been created.
:::

The _**developer**_ can create as many new **Input Groups** as needed, which are arranged vertically on top of each other. Each **Input Group** can be renamed, deleted, or dragged to change its vertical position relative to the other **Input Groups**. For example, the image below shows two **Input Groups** named "Input Group 1" and `"Input Group 2".

## Input Group Layout

In an **Input Group**:

- The _**developer**_ can add as many inputs as needed..
- The inputs can be resized and moved within the input group using the mouse.
- A maximum of 10 inputs can appear on the same row.
- There is no restriction on the number of rows to be used.
  - The height of the **Input Group** will automatically adjust as more inputs are added, removed, or dragged.

As an example, the image below shows an input group with 5 different inputs (two numerical inputs, two text inputs, and one single select input).
