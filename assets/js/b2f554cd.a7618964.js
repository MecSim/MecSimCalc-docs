With a few very simple steps, educators and professionals can create interactive web applications for their students or clients.\\n\\n**MecSimCalc** has been a concept in my head since I joined the Engineering Faculty at the University of Alberta in 2007. At the time, I was looking for an easy way to create interactive web examples for my students to help them visualize different Mathematical and Engineering concepts. Throughout the years, I experimented with [webMathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/products/webmathematica/) and [javascripts](https://www.javascript.com/). However, dealing with web infrastructure has always been a struggle. I still remember the agony of trying to switch my whole website from traditional HTTP to HTTPS or the yearly agony of renewing the licenses of the different components that I was using. Throughout the years, my experience has shaped my vision for creating **MecSimCalc** as a platform that frees the developer from all the ever changing web architecture to allow them to focus on their application.\\n\\n**MecSimCalc** is a simple, yet extremely powerful platform that has applications in a large array of fields. Here is an example in [Medicine](https://www.mecsimcalc.com/app/7188609/diabetes_risk), by answering a simple questionnaire, a visitor to the app can identify their diabetes risk. The app was created based on an algorithm published on a [Canadian government website](https://www.healthycanadians.gc.ca/en/canrisk). For University Mathematics [Education](https://www.mecsimcalc.com/app/4730621/numerical_integration), a student can enter any functional expression and the limits of an integral while the interactive app would calculate the numerical integral and would provide a plot, powered by `matplotlib` for visual illustration of the example.\\n\\nWe created **MecSimCalc** for professionals in engineering and finance. Consider the [app](https://www.mecsimcalc.com/app/3333910/mortgage_calculator) that can be distributed by a mortgage specialist to his or her clients to help them identify the price of the house that matches their finances. Or consider the [Engineering app](https://www.mecsimcalc.com/app/8106967/cor_las_model) that uses the [CorLAS](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309917227_Review_of_Engineering_Fracture_Mechanics_Model_for_Pipeline_Applications) algorithm to calculate the failure pressure of pipelines with longitudinal crack like features. While these apps are currently publicly available, we can work with any professionals to help them build and share their specific applications only with their clients.\\n\\nI welcome all our visitors to [explore](https://www.mecsimcalc.com/explore) the different applications that have been created using **MecSimCalc**.\\n\\nWe also invite all professionals, scientists, and educators who would like to publicly or privately publish their lively algorithms to try out our **free** platform. We promise to keep it free for any publicly available applications. We are also happy to work with any professionals wishing to use **MecSimCalc** for their enterprise applications.\\n\\nPlease send us any suggestions, questions, or inquiries to info@mecsimcalc.com"}]}')}}]);
