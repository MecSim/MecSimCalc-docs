Streamlit runs on websockets, making it suitable for interactive real-time applications.\\n\\nHere is a simplified workflow for creating and deploying a basic Streamlit app:\\n\\n**Step 1:** Download and start streamlit via the terminal:\\n\\n```bash\\n# Prerequisite: download Python and pip, if not already installed\\npip install streamlit\\ntouch my_app.py\\nstreamlit run my_app.py\\n```\\n\\nAfter running `streamlit run`, a new tab will open in your browser with the app running at a `localhost` url. All the coding will be done locally on your computer and edits in `my_app.py` will automatically be reflected in the browser.\\n\\n**Step 2:** Write the Streamlit code inside `my_app.py`. Refer to Streamlit docs for custom `st` functions required to build the interface and layout.\\n\\n```python\\n# my_app.py\\n\\nimport streamlit as st\\n\\nst.write(\\"# a+b\\")\\n\\ncol1, col2, col3 = st.columns([6, 1, 6])\\nwith col1:\\n    a = st.number_input(\\"a\\", value=12)\\nwith col2:\\n    st.write(\\"# +\\")\\nwith col3:\\n    b = st.number_input(\\"b\\", value=34)\\n\\nsum = a + b\\nproduct = a * b\\n\\nst.write(\\"The sum of the two numbers is \\" + str(sum))\\nst.write(\\"The product of the two numbers is \\" + str(product))\\n```\\n\\n**Step 3:** The inputs, code, and outputs are all handled in the single Python file. The localhost webpage looks like this:\\n![Streamlit app](/blog/compare/streamlit_app.png)\\n\\n**Step 4:** Before deploying the app, first create a [Github](https://github.com/) account and a new Github repository. Then save the code to the repository by downloading and using the Github desktop app or using the terminal:\\n\\n```bash\\ngit add .\\ngit commit -m \\"saving my_app.py\\"\\ngit push\\n```\\n\\n**Step 4:** Finally, to deploy the app to Streamlit cloud, create a streamlit cloud account and fill out the _Deploy an app_ form with the Github repository link. Once submitted, the app will build for a few minutes before becoming accessible at a streamlit url.\\n\\n<div style={{ width:\\"100%\\", overflow: \\"hidden\\" }}>\\n<video muted=\\"\\" loop=\\"\\" controls style={{ width:\\"100%\\", overflow: \\"hidden\\" }}>\\n    <source src=\\"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.streamlit.io/videos/streamlit_sharing_silent.mp4\\"/>\\n</video>\\n</div>\\n\\n### MecSimCalc\\n\\nInternally, MecSimCalc uses serverless functions to run Python functions, make it suitable for computational simulation and calculation, which may require more computing power and longer runtimes.\\n\\nHere is a simplified workflow for creating and deploying a basic MecSimCalc app:\\n\\n**Step 1:** Visit https://mecsimcalc.com/create and select one of the templates to create a new app.\\n![Create page](/blog/compare/mecsimcalc_create.png)\\n\\n**Step 2:** On the inputs step, use the drag and drop interface to add, delete, and position the inputs. Edit the each input by clicking on it.\\n![Inputs step](/blog/compare/mecsimcalc_inputs.png)\\n![Edit inputs](/blog/compare/mecsimcalc_edit_inputs.png)\\n\\n**Step 3:** On the code step, write the Python code that uses the `inputs` to calculate the output. No need for custom functions nor installations. The toolbar on the right allows for installing Python packages, debugging the code, and seeing the input variables.\\n![Code step](/blog/compare/mecsimcalc_code.png)\\n\\n**Step 4:** On the outputs step, use the rich text editor to stylize the outputs and embed the outputs variables from the code.\\n![Outputs step](/blog/compare/mecsimcalc_outputs.png)\\n\\n**Step 5:** Finally, to deploy the app, simply click on the _Publish_ button at the bottom of the Preview step and the app will be accessible at a MecSimCalc url within a few seconds.\\n![Publish](/blog/compare/mecsimcalc_publish.png)\\n\\nThis is the final app:\\n![MecSimCalc app](/blog/compare/mecsimcalc_app.png)\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nStreamlit and MecSimCalc offer solutions to different segments of users. Streamlit is designed for developers who want to create interactive data apps rapidly but may require familiarity with custom Streamlit functions and terminal/Github integration. On the other hand, MecSimCalc is tailored for non-technical users, eliminating the need to change existing Python codes and works in-browser."},{"id":"vs-anvil-works-2023","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/vs-anvil-works-2023","source":"@site/blog/2023-10-22-vs-anvil-works.md","title":"Anvil vs. MecSimCalc","description":"Banner","date":"2023-10-22T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"October 22, 2023","tags":[{"label":"Compare","permalink":"/blog/tags/compare"}],"readingTime":4.175,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Weichen Qiu","title":"MecSimCalc Co-founder","url":"https://github.com/w3ichen","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57570491","key":"wqiu"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"vs-anvil-works-2023","title":"Anvil vs. MecSimCalc","authors":["wqiu"],"tags":["Compare"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Streamlit vs. MecSimCalc","permalink":"/blog/vs-streamlit-2023"},"nextItem":{"title":"MecSimCalc Hackathon 5.0 (January 21st - January 28th, 2023) Winners","permalink":"/blog/Comp01212023-Winners"}},"content":"![Banner](/blog/compare/vs_anvil_banner.jpg)\\n\\nIn today\'s fast-paced digital world, the ability to develop web applications quickly and efficiently can make a significant difference for businesses and developers alike.

Let\'s explore how Anvil and MecSimCalc facilitate the app building and deploying process.\\n\\n### Anvil\\n\\nAnvil runs a web server that communicates with a database and other processes.\\n\\n**Step 1:** Create a new app by selecting from one of the Anvil templates\\n![Create page](/blog/compare/anvil_create.jpg)\\n\\n**Step 2:** On the inputs page, use the side menu on the right to configure each input settings and drag-and-drop in more inputs.\\n![Inputs page](/blog/compare/anvil_inputs.png)\\n![New component](/blog/compare/anvil_new_component.png)\\n\\n**Step 3:** On the code page, use custom anvil functions to write the Python code that uses the input values to execute commands, such as database executions.\\n![Code page](/blog/compare/anvil_code.png)\\n\\n**Step 4:** Finally, to deploy the app, open the Publish popup and click on Publish\\n![Publish](/blog/compare/anvil_publish.png)\\n\\n**Step 5:** The app is now deployed and accessible at an Anvil url:\\nKeep in mind that Anvil apps on the free tier come with a banner at the top.\\n\\n![Anvil app](/blog/compare/anvil_app.png)\\n\\n### MecSimCalc\\n\\nInternally, MecSimCalc uses serverless functions to run Python functions, make it suitable for computational simulation and calculation, which may require more computing power and longer runtimes.\\n\\nHere is a simplified workflow for creating and deploying a basic MecSimCalc app:\\n\\n**Step 1:** Visit https://mecsimcalc.com/create and select one of the templates to create a new app.\\n![Create page](/blog/compare/mecsimcalc_create.png)\\n\\n**Step 2:** On the inputs step, use the drag and drop interface to add, delete, and position the inputs. Edit the each input by clicking on it.\\n![Inputs step](/blog/compare/mecsimcalc_inputs.png)\\n![Edit inputs](/blog/compare/mecsimcalc_edit_inputs.png)\\n\\n**Step 3:** On the code step, write the Python code that uses the `inputs` to calculate the output. No need for custom functions nor installations. The toolbar on the right allows for installing Python packages, debugging the code, and seeing the input variables.\\n![Code step](/blog/compare/mecsimcalc_code.png)\\n\\n**Step 4:** On the outputs step, use the rich text editor to stylize the outputs and embed the outputs variables from the code.\\n![Outputs step](/blog/compare/mecsimcalc_outputs.png)\\n\\n**Step 5:** Finally, to deploy the app, simply click on the _Publish_ button at the bottom of the Preview step and the app will be accessible at a MecSimCalc url within a few seconds.\\n![Publish](/blog/compare/mecsimcalc_publish.png)\\n\\nThis is the final app:\\n![MecSimCalc app](/blog/compare/mecsimcalc_app.png)\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nBoth Anvil and MecSimCalc aim to simplify web application development, enabling users to leverage the power of Python without the need for extensive web development experience. While Anvil is designed for building full-fledged websites and offers more features, MecSimCalc is geared towards non-technical users and simplifies complex computations.\\n\\n### Key Takeaways\\n\\n- MecSimCalc offers a solution for simplifying complex calculations with Python.\\n- Anvil\'s extensive feature set can create complexity, but it is more suitable for building full-fledged websites.\\n- MecSimCalc excels at simplifying the app-building process for non-technical users.\\n\\nIn summary, the choice between Anvil and MecSimCalc depends on your specific needs and the complexity of the web applications you intend to develop. Both tools offer the power of Python, but with different target audiences and features."},{"id":"Comp01212023-Winners","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/Comp01212023-Winners","source":"@site/blog/2023-03-05-Hackathon-5-Winners.md","title":"MecSimCalc Hackathon 5.0 (January 21st - January 28th, 2023) Winners","description":"At the beginning of 2023, MecSimCalc ran our sixth hackathon.

So I\u2019m really astonished but very proud about the end result.\\n\\n### ___About my app and why I made it___\\n\\nAs the theme of the hackathon was creating a calculator, I was first thinking of traditional conversion calculator (like height, weight, distance, etc.) as I\u2019m from Europe & you are from North America.\\n\\nMeanwhile It sounds too simple & I want also to try the possibility to display some visuals (what sounds difficult with a conversion calculator).\\n\\nThen comes to me this idea of Annualized RoR  with also explanation of compound interest. Also, the Annualized RoR  is really useful if you want to compare different possible investments & not so straight forward to obtain by doing mental calculation (at least for me \ud83d\ude09). So I can indeed rely on a tool for this calculation & this can be useful for others as well so a good reason to publish on a web site.\\n\\n### ___My experience with MecSimCalc___\\n\\nI have to say MecSimCalc is really easy to use & it corresponds to my philosophy of working. Indeed, my side I prefer to work on the business logic part (backend side) of an app and  don\u2019t want to pass too much time developing the frontend part. So having a framework proposing me a no-code approach for the presentation part meets my expectations. Your idea to have a reach text editor, a collection of input fields with pre-validation of parameter values is really great.\\n\\nFor the input part, I was able to very quickly present/document the app using text editor (instead of HTML or Markdown that will takes more time). The default template of presentation is good. Of course there is no possibility to have too much customization but for me, at the moment I have a default nice layout, I have no problem to stitch to it. The only issue I have seen is related to the mobile view (see more details at the end of this e-mail)\\n\\nFor the output part, integrating Jinja to a rich text editor instead of HTML is just awesome.\\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n## **[Black Scholes (Top 5 App)](https://mecsimcalc.com/app/8739983/black_scholes)**\\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n### ___About Amysoj J A Exson Joseph___\\n\\nI am a computer science engineering student in my final year, hailing from Tamil Nadu, India. Building websites and native applications is a hobby of mine, and I am eager to take the skills and knowledge I have gained through my studies to the next level. I am excited to see where my interests in technology will take me in the future.\\n\\n### ___About my App___\\n\\nI built a Black-Scholes option pricing calculator app to provide a simple and user-friendly interface for determining option prices. My goal is to support informed decision-making in finance by combining my technical and financial knowledge.\\n\\n### ___My experience with MecSimCalc___\\n\\nI recently started using MecSimCalc and I am thoroughly impressed with its capabilities. As a Python developer, I appreciate the ease with which I can create and share web applications with just a few clicks. The platform\'s intuitive interface and streamlined process have saved me so much time and effort compared to other similar tools I have used in the past. I highly recommend MecSimCalc to any Python developer looking for a fast and simple way to create and share web applications.\\n\\n______________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n## __We are hosting another hackathon from March 18th - March 25th 2023.

I am Tanya Sabarwal from Chennai, India. I am in the final year of my Computer Science and Engineering undergraduate degree. My passion for Machine Learning, Data Science, and Visualization drew me to this hackathon and I also intend to pursue my master\'s degree in this field.\\n\\nHello! I\u2019m Piyush Mohan from India and I\u2019m a student currently in my final year of B.Tech. I enjoy taking part in various hackathons and bringing innovative ideas to life via projects such as the one mentioned here. My area of interests lie in fields of Data Analytics and Visualisation and I also like to work with Machine Learning & Deep Learning.\\n\\n### ___About our App___\\n\\nAs soon as we decided to take part in the hackathon, we hopped onto MecSimCalc\u2019s explore page and also went through the list of supported libraries. While doing so, we realised that there weren\u2019t enough apps made with Folium and having worked with it before in previous hackathons, we decided to go with it.\\n\\nThe application provides an insight to the Vehicle Collision problem in New York. It provides an easy way of simplifying and analysing the data with interactive maps that can be customised on the basis of user inputs. Apart from spreading awareness about the issue, the app also helps in visualising and learning more about the problem which would eventually lead to better solutions and regulations to road safety.\\n\\n### ___My experience with MecSimCalc___\\n\\nMecSimCalc is a very good platform for beginners and its flexibility also makes it a wonderful tool for experienced developers to create apps of any kind. The website\'s samples and tutorials were quite helpful and beginner-friendly which is always a great kickstart. We loved being able to write code and test it directly in the browser. The drag-and-drop interface for input widgets is simple to use and helped in adding or changing elements quickly. Overall, we are glad to have tried it and will definitely continue using it for future projects.\\n\\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n## **[Indonesia Tourism Destination Recommendation System](https://mecsimcalc.com/app/4014960/indonesia_tourism_destination_recommendation_syste)**\\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n### ___About Rafka Imanda Putra___\\n\\n12th-grade student from SMK Negeri 4 Bandung majoring in software engineering. I started learning programming in early 2021 and have an interest in machine learning and back-end development. Apart from that, I am also active in coaching students to become skilled by taught basics of web development and personal branding for members of the IT extracurricular at my school.\\n\\n### ___About my App___\\n\\nThe Indonesia Tourism Destination Recommendation System aims to provide recommendations on tourist attractions for tourists who want to visit the top 5 cities in Indonesia, especially on the island of Java. This recommendation system is built with content-based filtering which will return locations based on the similarity of the category the user wants.\\n\\n### ___My experience with MecSimCalc___\\n\\nIt is an excellent platform for building computing tools and even implementing machine learning. At first, the app that I had only ran on a local notebook, where the user had to run all the code to get recommendations. But with MecSimCalc, users can directly input what they want and quickly where recommendations will be displayed.\\n\\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n## **[Statistics Helper](https://mecsimcalc.com/app/6935137/statistics_helper)**\\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n### ___About Akshay Kumar Sharma___\\n\\nHi! I\'m Akshay Kumar Sharma. I am a full-stack web developer. I am currently in 11th standard. I love maths and coding.\\n\\n### ___About my App___\\n\\nI made the Statistics Helper app in Mecsimcalc Hackathon 4. I made this statistics problem solver app to automate some of the hard work to do when we are solving stats. This app can provide quick results via tables, graphs, formulas etc. This app is also a great resource to learn stats for newcomers as it explains every step of it\'s solution.\\n\\nI built this project because there\'s been a lot of times when I have solve lengthy questions on stats and one silly mistake can make all the efforts go into vain. So, to learn myself and to help others learn stats, I made this app. Stats is a very interesting subject, It can reveal many fascinating outcomes but before that you have to do some hard calculations if your data is big. There are many calculators on the internet but a very few of them provide solution and nothing is like \\"Statistics Helper\\" which also provides tables, graphs, what formula was used etc.\\n\\n### ___My experience with MecSimCalc___\\n\\nI really enjoyed participating in the mecsimcalc hackathon and thought that the event was very well-organized. I appreciated the opportunity to work on my own projects and get help and support from the mentors and organizers when needed. The prizes and incentives were also motivating, and I felt that they added an extra level of excitement to the event. Overall, my experience at the hackathon was excellent and I would definitely participate in future events hosted by mecsimcalc. Thank you for putting on such a great event!\\n\\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n## **[Color Pallet Generator](https://mecsimcalc.com/app/1127600/color_pallet_generator)**\\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n## __We are hosting another hackathon from January 21st - January 28th 2023.

I\'m a Lebanese senior high school student passionate about coding and motorsports. I started programming at 14 years old with Python. I like other tech disciplines such as Cybersecurity, Arduino, and multi-platform app development. I\'m planning on following a major in Computer Science to specialize in Software Engineering. \\n\\n### ___About My App___\\n\\nBeing a math passionate, I\'ve always wondered if I could automate some mathematical processes of solving problems. I knew there was something that we use more often than we realize: the quadratic functions. \\nHence, on the occasion of MecSimCalc\'s Hackathon 2.0, I made a Quadratic Equations Solver. As its name suggests, it solves quadratic equations in their standard form: ax\xb2 + bx + c = 0, providing you with analytical and descriptive results to help you find solutions easily.\\n\\n### ___My experience with MecSimCalc___\\n\\nI\'m so grateful for joining MecSimCalc. I\'ve had a wonderful experience working in its coding environment. MecSimCalc solves the hard side of creating GUIs with a drag-and-drop solution. The interface is very intuitive and easy to understand. It has more features than I expected like the integration of LaTeX, geospatial utilities, handling files and processing images, etc... The best part is that you don\'t need prior experience in web development. You can simply create a Python web app and deploy it instantly within minutes!\\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n## **[Quality of Life App](https://mecsimcalc.com/app/6185690/quality_of_life_app)**\\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n### ___About Anika Krishnan___\\n\\nI am a high schooler in Redmond, WA, USA. I love to build social and community apps, especially apps that use data science/analytics.\\n\\n### ___About My App___\\n\\nAt this time, Air quality in my area is poor and some of my friends that have asthma/allergies are having to temporarily move to other locations. This was the inspiration for the idea. When one moves to a city, many things are important for your quality of your life, eg.: Air Quality, Safety, Traffic, Covid Risk, Cost of Milk and Eggs, Housing costs and more.. Wouldn\'t it be nice to know how the city measures on all the things that are important to you? The Quality of Life app uses many sources to gather data and calculate scores in different areas like air quality, pollen, job climate so you can visualize all the data and make informed decisions.\\n\\n### ___My experience with MecSimCalc___\\n\\nIt was very easy to get started. The examples and tutorials were very helpful. It took very little time to have the triangle example working. While building the application, I really appreciated being able to write the code and test it directly in the browser and was able to build a good app with some UI during the hackathon. Things that would make this platform more powerful include being able to more during inputs ( html/js), more support for additional libraries ( maybe allow users to add). It was a bit hard to debug ( being able to step through Jupyter notebooks may be useful). Overall I really enjoyed this experience and being able to build an app with UI and inputs/outputs without having to learn about all the other systems.\\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n## **[Your Trip Buddy](https://mecsimcalc.com/app/0866015/your_trip_buddy)**\\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n### ___About Vaibhav Thalanki___\\n\\nI am Vaibhav Thalanki from Chennai, India. I am currently pursuing my undergraduate in computer science at VIT University. Some things I am very much interested in are deep learning and product development. I have participated in quite a few hackathons before this one. I also attended the previous MecSlimCalc buildathon.\\n\\n### ___About My App___\\n\\nThe app that I created for this hackathon is called \'Your Trip Buddy\', it gives you information about the weather, airports, and time zones for your trip\'s destination. I used a few APIs for building the app. It eases the process by collecting information from different sources and putting it in a friendly format for the user to read. \\n\\n### ___My experience with MecSimCalc___\\n\\nMecSimCalc is an amazing platform to work on and explore. The professor and the students behind the MecSlimCalc project have succeeded in their goals. The website is simply brilliant and I would be using it for a lot more stuff. Ciao!\\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n## **[Auto Base64 Decode](https://mecsimcalc.com/app/7698150/auto_base_64_decode)**\\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n### ___About Noah Ergezinger___\\n\\nI graduated in December 2021 and started working full-time at Ezoic this past February. I actually worked on this website during one of the summer breaks while in university, so I was very excited when they announced the Buildathon. It was great to see the progress made since I had last worked on it and that it was seeing lots of use.\\n\\n### ___About My App___\\n\\nIn a nutshell, Auto Base64 Decode takes a string, finds any base64-encoded portions, decodes them, and inserts them back into the original string. I made my app because it was actually something I needed at work. Many of our web requests contain encoded data, and when debugging, we constantly need to copy the data into a decoder, which gets tedious. I thought it would be great to be able to automatically decode the relevant portions without needing to copy each one by hand. I\'ve shared it with my team, and we\'ve already been using it a ton.\\n\\n### ___My experience with MecSimCalc___\\n\\nBuilding a script or tool and easily sharing it was precisely the original use case for MecSimCalc, and I\'m happy to see that come to fruition. I look forward to what comes next, and I hope the MecSimCalc team sees nothing but success!\\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n## __We are hosting another hackathon from November 5th - November 12th 2022, please check out the [DevPost](https://mecsimcalc-hackathon-3.devpost.com/) to find out more!__\\n\\n![Hackathon 3.0 Poster](/blog/MecSimCalc_Presents_3.png)"},{"id":"JohnYu-apps2","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/JohnYu-apps2","source":"@site/blog/2022-08-22-John-apps2.md","title":"Johns Yu\'s Apps 2","description":"The following blogposts were written by John Yu for apps he had created on MecSimCalc.

The app uses a technique called Taguchi Orthogonal Arrays such that\\nevery pairing of variables appears in at least one test case. This method is significantly more\\npowerful and more efficient compared to brute-force testing. You can get full testing coverage\\nof your program using significantly less test cases. This can save you a lot of time and a lot of\\nmoney depending on the size of your program.\\n\\n### ___Why I made this app___\\n\\nSoftware testing is a critical step in the software development lifecycle. There are countless\\nopportunities for mistakes and defects to come up at any point in the development of software.\\nFixing code is equally as important as creating code. Finding these bugs early in the\\ndevelopment lifecycle will help to mitigate issues that come up later. The hard part of testing\\ncode is generating test cases. Full code coverage often comes with a huge set of test cases\\nwhich is expensive and time consuming. A small set of test cases is cost effective but lacks code\\ncoverage. I made this app to help software engineers generate test cases that can provide\\nadequate code coverage in a reasonable amount of test cases. This saves you a lot of time and\\nmoney and improves the quality of your code.\\n\\n## **Simple Linear Regression and Discrete Probability Distribution**\\n\\nThis blog post is dedicated to the [Simple Linear Regression](https://mecsimcalc.com/app/3625435/simple_linear_regression) and [Visualizing Discrete Probability Distributions](https://mecsimcalc.com/app/8359657/visualizing_discrete_probability_distributions) apps created by John Yu.\\n\\n### ___About the Simple Linear Regression and the Discrete Probability Distribution App___\\n\\nThe simple linear regression app can generate a regression line from your set of data points.\\nThe app is intended to be a helpful tool for Statistics students to understand how the linear\\nregression line is calculated. There are no statistical libraries used in the calculation of the\\nregression line. All calculations are done using equations from my statistics textbook. The app\\nwill calculate the regression line as well as show you how the calculation is performed. In\\nstatistics, there are many formulas that can calculate a regression line. This app uses the\\nsimplest equation to help students gain a better understanding of how the regression line is\\ncalculated.\\n\\nThe Discrete Probability Distribution app can visualize common probability distributions in\\nStatistics. This app is intended to be a helpful tool for students taking Statistics to understand\\nhow these probability distributions work. The user can play around with the parameters of the\\ndistributions defined in the app inputs to understand how these parameters impact the graph.\\n\\n## **Truth Table Generator**\\n\\nThis blog post is dedicated to the [Truth Table Generator](https://mecsimcalc.com/app/4669459/truth_table_generator) app created by John Yu.\\n\\n### ___About the Truth Table Generator App___\\n\\nThe truth table generator is an app that can generate a truth table by defining a logical\\nexpression. You can define a logic expression simply by typing it into the app inputs. The app\\nwill evaluate your expression with each possible combination of inputs and return the expected\\noutput. This app is intended to be used by students taking a digital logic class who need to\\nquickly generate a truth table. Sometimes a logic expression may be very complicated to\\nevaluate by hand. This app can generate a truth table with any expression no matter how\\ncomplicated it is. Students will find this app by helpful for verifying your truth table. The app\\nhas been tested multiple times to ensure that the expected outputs are correct."},{"id":"websiteplanet-2022","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/websiteplanet-2022","source":"@site/blog/2022-08-03-Webtools.md","title":"Useful Webtools","description":"This blogpost is dedicated to webtools developed by WebsitePlanet.

From electrical and computer engineering to healthcare and medicine, Dorsa is passionate about the intersection between technology and healthcare. In creating iMedic, Dorsa aimed to define the patient experience, and to address the ongoing predicament surrounding the chronic lack of access to efficient and accurate medical diagnosis. Indeed, across the continuum of care, the execution of ethical medical examination is of high precedence. In her spare time, she enjoys challenging herself, as well as performing the cello with her local string orchestra. \\n\\n### ___Bio: Videet Mehta___\\n\\nVideet Mehta is a rising Junior at Dulles High School in Sugar Land Texas. He is passionate about both medicine and technology. For the last four years, he has built robots that have been placed at the top of the First Tech Challenge state and world championships. He also does competitive programming and is currently in the silver division of the USACO competition. He learned python and ML just over a year ago. And since then, he has created many medically related machine learning projects. Additionally, he is the co-founder of two ed-tech companies: Project SUCCEED ([projectsucceed.org](https://projectsucceed.org/)) and Xceleration ([xceleration.org](https://xceleration.org/dl/welcome)). \\n\\n### ___Bio: Zarik Khan___\\n\\nHi, I\'m Zarik Khan and I\'m a rising junior at Dulles High School. I\'m passionate about machine learning, bioinformatics, web development, biomedical engineering, and app development. I worked with Videet and Dorsa to create iMedic to contribute to the distribution of medical technology in areas around the world that lack accessible access. Our project was made to detect some of the fatal causes of death in these areas to provide people a way to monitor their health and take necessary action quickly. MecsimCalc allowed us to integrate our python code into an easy, aesthetic, and secure front-end system. We hope to innovate on our current project by improving the accuracy of our calculations, expanding our app\'s reach, and developing new features. \\n\\n### ___About iMedic___\\n\\nFrom the detection of infectious, cancerous, and cardiovascular diseases using a variety of means; to academic tools such as 3D computations of Chaos Theory, iMedic is a multipurpose platform that uses ML, AI, libraries, and big data. As an app created for Third World countries & rural areas, it is for individuals who do not have access to medical support nor fast and efficient examination. iMedic is designed to be used frequently to evaluate one\'s risks for the most common medical conditions, and to provide users with knowledge of their current health. In addition, iMedic includes cutting-edge tools for research. By including a chaos calculator\u2014that computes & graphs chaotic systems such as the Lorenz Attractor & Logistic Map with yielded data via input\u2014iMedic has many applications to fields extending far beyond medicine, such as data science, math, and CS as well.\\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n## **[Javelin Power Saver](https://mecsimcalc.com/app/1569496/javelin_power_saver_cuts_your_electricity_bill_smartly)**\\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n### ___Bio: Chetan Tyagi___\\n\\nI am Chetan Tyagi, who will be joining University of Alberta for the undergraduate in Computing Science this fall, and is very keen to learn new things about the subject and keep up to date with the latest technologies.\\n\\n### ___About Javelin Power Saver___\\n\\nMy app is called \\"Javelin Power Saver\\". As the name suggests, this application aims to conserve your energy, and therefore cut your bill. With the help of this easy-to-use app, you will be able to\\n-calculate the power your appliances uses per month -the total money you spend on them in a month \\n-compare yourself with the electricity bill of an average citizen \\n-compare your appliances with popular products in the same range\\n\\n### ___Why I made this app___\\n\\nAs per a report by World Economic Forum, the end use efficiency of electricity in residential environment in USA is a mere 65%, signifying the level of wastage of energy. The waste of electricity ends up in increasing the costs for the user, while also making a carbon footprint on the environment. The application will focus on conserving electricity. The target users of this application will be all the people who use electricity in their homes.\\n\\nA big proportion of people in both urban and rural areas use electrical appliances and pay the electricity bill. It is common to look at the bill and thinking how the cost can be reduced. But as there is no way of accurately understanding how, we guess on different appliances, which makes the process harder. This application solves this. Also, before getting a new electrical appliance, we will be able to estimate the total power consumption, estimate total costs, compare with average households, and recommend how the user can make the combination of electrical appliances more efficient.\\n\\n### ___My experience with MecSimCalc___\\n\\nCompared from my previous experiences of creating web-apps, making apps here is much easier than anywhere else I have seen on the internet. It is completely free, encouraging both beginners and professionals to create apps without any hindrance. Overall, this is a great website to work on and I will recommend it to everyone interested in creating apps using Python.\\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n## **[Grids for artists](https://mecsimcalc.com/app/5416553/grids_for_artists)**\\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n### ___Bio: Camilo Andr\xe9s Rojas Hern\xe1ndez___\\n\\nI am Camilo Andr\xe9s Rojas Hern\xe1ndez, mathematics student at the Universidad Nacional de Colombia Medellin, since about 6 years ago I have learned on my own the development in python, its libraries and frameworks, something that identifies me is self-taught learning because over the years I have developed both soft skills and technical skills in the language, I am very motivated by programming and learning things every day.\\n\\n### ___About Grids for artists___\\n\\nI made this application because since my sister studies plastic arts, sometimes she has problems when it comes to making guide grids for her canvases, so I wanted to satisfy that need she had using python and the MecSimCalc tool, it is very easy to use, plus it has the main libraries, such as machine learning and image processing, in this case with Pillow, the input and output of data is very comfortable, anyone can share and create applications in record time. Awesome!\\n\\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n## **[2D Heat Equation Visualizer](https://mecsimcalc.com/app/5317027/2_d_heat_equation_visualizer)**\\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n### ___Bio: Jasper Eitzen and About 2D Heat Equation Visualizer___\\n\\nMy name is Jasper Eitzen, I\u2019m currently a graduate student at the University of Alberta, pursuing a Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering. The work I do for my thesis mostly consists of lab experiments, although I do have experience using Python to analyse experimental data as well as some programming experience from my undergrad and graduate studies. I came up with the idea for 2D Heat Equation Visualizer from having written some simple numerical solvers in the past and seeing that MecSimCalc could provide a convenient way to get inputs from the user. I thought that the results of such an app could look quite interesting since I\u2019ve done similar projects in the past, and I always found it cool to set up an initial condition and see how it evolves over time based on math and physics. With contour plots as outputs, users can play around with the app\u2019s inputs to try and get unique results. I needed quite a few inputs and the input page on MecSimCalc was very useful in letting me lay them all out and provide explanations so that the user could pick values that provide good results. As someone with no experience in web development, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to make something like this app without the interface that MecSimCalc provided.\\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n## **[LymeML](https://mecsimcalc.com/app/4663263/lyme_ml)**\\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n### ___Bio: Soham Jain___\\n\\nSoham Jain is currently a sophomore with a passion for machine learning at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, a prestigious high school that is ranked #1 in the United States. He works as a Machine Learning Engineer for a local start-up company called Vytal, where he assists in creating novel ML algorithms for fast and comprehensive neurologic and cardiac assessment through smartphone-based applications. In the past, he has worked closely with machine learning models using classification techniques to diagnose medical conditions, such as Malaria and Lyme disease. He has also won several awards from hackathons in the past through developing contemporary algorithms and deploying applications to assist with effective clinical diagnoses. As a technology specialist on the executive committee for his school\'s Student Government Association, Soham has used his experience in computer science to assist the student body with leading events and initiatives. Soham is also passionate about competition math, as he has competed in numerous national-level contests such as AIME, AMC 10, and MathCounts. Outside of school, Soham likes to tutor other students, play the piano, spend time with friends, and listen to music.\\n\\n### ___About LymeML___\\n\\nLymeML is an application built on MecSimCalc that uses novel machine learning algorithms to diagnose Lyme disease, a prevalent issue in numerous countries around the world. Research suggests that 14% of the world\'s population is currently affected or has been affected in the past with Lyme disease, contributing to the significance of this issue. Contemporary methods to diagnose this disease require a blood test. with lab reports anticipated to arrive three or four weeks after the patient seeks medical attention. However, waiting several days to receive a diagnosis allows symptoms to worsen, causing detrimental and irreversible damage to the brain or heart. Soham Jain, a current high school sophomore in the United States and Machine Learning Engineer at a local startup company, noticed that this issue can be resolved through creating a machine learning algorithm that sends an effective and immediate result to the user through image classification and a self-check symptoms diagnosis. This app implements convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Python libraries such as NumPy and TensorFlow to accurately diagnose Lyme disease. Implementing this app will help several individuals living in remote areas to expedite the process of receiving a medical diagnosis, and differentiate their symptoms/rashes from those of other diseases. With the help of machine learning and MecSimCalc for making this app available to others, countless individuals will receive an instant diagnosis of Lyme disease and can treat their symptoms faster.\\n\\n### ___My experience with MecSimCalc___\\nWith the help of MecSimCalc, LymeML will continue on its mission to aid countless more individuals living in remote areas to receive an instant diagnosis for Lyme disease, and can treat their symptoms more efficiently. Through featuring LymeML as a winner for this hackathon, the opportunities for telemedicine and machine learning algorithms in the future has opened, and soon more accurate and immediate models will be created to diagnose several diseases. Creating the LymeML app through MecSimCalc was very straightforward and many Python libraries were accessible. The documentation and app analytics were also available, making my experience with this website more professional and enjoyable."},{"id":"masonry-calculators-2022","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/masonry-calculators-2022","source":"@site/blog/2022-07-18-masonry-calculators.md","title":"Masonry Calculators","description":"Masonry is the building of structures from individual units, which are often laid in and bound together by mortar.","date":"2022-07-18T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"July 18, 2022","tags":[{"label":"Calculators","permalink":"/blog/tags/calculators"},{"label":"Civil Engineering","permalink":"/blog/tags/civil-engineering"},{"label":"Engineering","permalink":"/blog/tags/engineering"}],"readingTime":2.74,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Mark Hagel","title":"Executive Director of Alberta Masonry Council","key":"mhagel"},{"name":"John Yu","title":"University Researcher","key":"jyu"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"masonry-calculators-2022","title":"Masonry Calculators","authors":["mhagel","jyu"],"tags":["Calculators","Civil Engineering","Engineering"]},"prevItem":{"title":"MecSimCalc Build-A-Thon (July 9th - July 16th, 2022) Winners","permalink":"/blog/Comp07092022-Winners"},"nextItem":{"title":"Circuit Analysis Calculators","permalink":"/blog/electrical-calculators-2022"}},"content":"> **Masonry** is the building of structures from individual units, which are often laid in and bound together by mortar.\\n\\n![masonry](/blog/masonry.jpeg)\\n\\n### Authors\\n\\n**Dr. Mark D.

Maximize, has 2 inputs with their coefficients. Assembly has 3 inputs, each being its respective coefficients, and Max demand has 1 input. The coefficients are aB+ bP = cC where B is brass, P is platinum, and C is the constant, with the input [a,b,c]. The inputs are interpreted into functions where it is drawn on the graph. There will be a feasible region where all boundaries will be satisfied. The program then picks all the intersections within the feasible region(note that some points will not be accounted for). The output just gives the profits given at that point on the graph. |\\n| [Cattle Profit](https://mecsimcalc.com/app/4532115/cattle_profit) | Max Profit Estimation | An application to maximize profits (only gives boundaries), the first table consists of the first element being the regular, and the 2nd being the premium. The second table consists of the first element being alfalfa and the second being barley. This can also be translated such as the required material for a toy car to be inputted, but in this case it is just using cattle profit as the output. The program basically just gives the boundaries and conditions of what to expect before proceeding onto the next step.                                                                                                                                                                |"},{"id":"welcome","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/welcome","source":"@site/blog/2022-03-02-welcome.md","title":"Welcome to MecSimCalc","description":"Welcome to our newly released MecSimCalc platform for creating and sharing computational tools on the web.

With a few very simple steps, educators and professionals can create interactive web applications for their students or clients.\\n\\n**MecSimCalc** has been a concept in my head since I joined the Engineering Faculty at the University of Alberta in 2007. At the time, I was looking for an easy way to create interactive web examples for my students to help them visualize different Mathematical and Engineering concepts. Throughout the years, I experimented with [webMathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/products/webmathematica/) and [javascripts](https://www.javascript.com/). However, dealing with web infrastructure has always been a struggle. I still remember the agony of trying to switch my whole website from traditional HTTP to HTTPS or the yearly agony of renewing the licenses of the different components that I was using. Throughout the years, my experience has shaped my vision for creating **MecSimCalc** as a platform that frees the developer from all the ever changing web architecture to allow them to focus on their application.\\n\\n**MecSimCalc** is a simple, yet extremely powerful platform that has applications in a large array of fields. Here is an example in [Medicine](https://www.mecsimcalc.com/app/7188609/diabetes_risk), by answering a simple questionnaire, a visitor to the app can identify their diabetes risk. The app was created based on an algorithm published on a [Canadian government website](https://www.healthycanadians.gc.ca/en/canrisk). For University Mathematics [Education](https://www.mecsimcalc.com/app/4730621/numerical_integration), a student can enter any functional expression and the limits of an integral while the interactive app would calculate the numerical integral and would provide a plot, powered by `matplotlib` for visual illustration of the example.\\n\\nWe created **MecSimCalc** for professionals in engineering and finance. Consider the [app](https://www.mecsimcalc.com/app/3333910/mortgage_calculator) that can be distributed by a mortgage specialist to his or her clients to help them identify the price of the house that matches their finances. Or consider the [Engineering app](https://www.mecsimcalc.com/app/8106967/cor_las_model) that uses the [CorLAS](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309917227_Review_of_Engineering_Fracture_Mechanics_Model_for_Pipeline_Applications) algorithm to calculate the failure pressure of pipelines with longitudinal crack like features. While these apps are currently publicly available, we can work with any professionals to help them build and share their specific applications only with their clients.\\n\\nI welcome all our visitors to [explore](https://www.mecsimcalc.com/explore) the different applications that have been created using **MecSimCalc**.\\n\\nWe also invite all professionals, scientists, and educators who would like to publicly or privately publish their lively algorithms to try out our **free** platform. We promise to keep it free for any publicly available applications. We are also happy to work with any professionals wishing to use **MecSimCalc** for their enterprise applications.\\n\\nPlease send us any suggestions, questions, or inquiries to info@mecsimcalc.com"}]}')}}]);
