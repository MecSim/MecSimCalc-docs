The app uses a technique called Taguchi Orthogonal Arrays such that\\nevery pairing of variables appears in at least one test case. This method is significantly more\\npowerful and more efficient compared to brute-force testing. You can get full testing coverage\\nof your program using significantly less test cases. This can save you a lot of time and a lot of\\nmoney depending on the size of your program.\\n\\n### ___Why I made this app___\\n\\nSoftware testing is a critical step in the software development lifecycle. There are countless\\nopportunities for mistakes and defects to come up at any point in the development of software.\\nFixing code is equally as important as creating code. Finding these bugs early in the\\ndevelopment lifecycle will help to mitigate issues that come up later. The hard part of testing\\ncode is generating test cases. Full code coverage often comes with a huge set of test cases\\nwhich is expensive and time consuming. A small set of test cases is cost effective but lacks code\\ncoverage. I made this app to help software engineers generate test cases that can provide\\nadequate code coverage in a reasonable amount of test cases. This saves you a lot of time and\\nmoney and improves the quality of your code.\\n\\n## **Simple Linear Regression and Discrete Probability Distribution**\\n\\nThis blog post is dedicated to the [Simple Linear Regression](https://mecsimcalc.com/app/3625435/simple_linear_regression) and [Visualizing Discrete Probability Distributions](https://mecsimcalc.com/app/8359657/visualizing_discrete_probability_distributions) apps created by John Yu.\\n\\n### ___About the Simple Linear Regression and the Discrete Probability Distribution App___\\n\\nThe simple linear regression app can generate a regression line from your set of data points.\\nThe app is intended to be a helpful tool for Statistics students to understand how the linear\\nregression line is calculated. There are no statistical libraries used in the calculation of the\\nregression line. All calculations are done using equations from my statistics textbook. The app\\nwill calculate the regression line as well as show you how the calculation is performed. In\\nstatistics, there are many formulas that can calculate a regression line. This app uses the\\nsimplest equation to help students gain a better understanding of how the regression line is\\ncalculated.\\n\\nThe Discrete Probability Distribution app can visualize common probability distributions in\\nStatistics. This app is intended to be a helpful tool for students taking Statistics to understand\\nhow these probability distributions work. The user can play around with the parameters of the\\ndistributions defined in the app inputs to understand how these parameters impact the graph.\\n\\n## **Truth Table Generator**\\n\\nThis blog post is dedicated to the [Truth Table Generator](https://mecsimcalc.com/app/4669459/truth_table_generator) app created by John Yu.\\n\\n### ___About the Truth Table Generator App___\\n\\nThe truth table generator is an app that can generate a truth table by defining a logical\\nexpression. You can define a logic expression simply by typing it into the app inputs. The app\\nwill evaluate your expression with each possible combination of inputs and return the expected\\noutput. This app is intended to be used by students taking a digital logic class who need to\\nquickly generate a truth table. Sometimes a logic expression may be very complicated to\\nevaluate by hand. This app can generate a truth table with any expression no matter how\\ncomplicated it is. Students will find this app by helpful for verifying your truth table. The app\\nhas been tested multiple times to ensure that the expected outputs are correct."},{"id":"websiteplanet-2022","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/websiteplanet-2022","source":"@site/blog/2022-08-03-Webtools.md","title":"Useful Webtools","description":"This blogpost is dedicated to webtools developed by WebsitePlanet.

By including a chaos calculator\u2014that computes & graphs chaotic systems such as the Lorenz Attractor & Logistic Map with yielded data via input\u2014iMedic has many applications to fields extending far beyond medicine, such as data science, math, and CS as well.\\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n## **[Javelin Power Saver](https://mecsimcalc.com/app/1569496/javelin_power_saver_cuts_your_electricity_bill_smartly)**\\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n### ___Bio: Chetan Tyagi___\\n\\nI am Chetan Tyagi, who will be joining University of Alberta for the undergraduate in Computing Science this fall, and is very keen to learn new things about the subject and keep up to date with the latest technologies.\\n\\n### ___About Javelin Power Saver___\\n\\nMy app is called \\"Javelin Power Saver\\". As the name suggests, this application aims to conserve your energy, and therefore cut your bill. With the help of this easy-to-use app, you will be able to\\n-calculate the power your appliances uses per month -the total money you spend on them in a month \\n-compare yourself with the electricity bill of an average citizen \\n-compare your appliances with popular products in the same range\\n\\n### ___Why I made this app___\\n\\nAs per a report by World Economic Forum, the end use efficiency of electricity in residential environment in USA is a mere 65%, signifying the level of wastage of energy. The waste of electricity ends up in increasing the costs for the user, while also making a carbon footprint on the environment. The application will focus on conserving electricity. The target users of this application will be all the people who use electricity in their homes.\\n\\nA big proportion of people in both urban and rural areas use electrical appliances and pay the electricity bill. It is common to look at the bill and thinking how the cost can be reduced. But as there is no way of accurately understanding how, we guess on different appliances, which makes the process harder. This application solves this. Also, before getting a new electrical appliance, we will be able to estimate the total power consumption, estimate total costs, compare with average households, and recommend how the user can make the combination of electrical appliances more efficient.\\n\\n### ___My experience with MecSimCalc___\\n\\nCompared from my previous experiences of creating web-apps, making apps here is much easier than anywhere else I have seen on the internet. It is completely free, encouraging both beginners and professionals to create apps without any hindrance. Overall, this is a great website to work on and I will recommend it to everyone interested in creating apps using Python.\\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n## **[Grids for artists](https://mecsimcalc.com/app/5416553/grids_for_artists)**\\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n### ___Bio: Camilo Andr\xe9s Rojas Hern\xe1ndez___\\n\\nI am Camilo Andr\xe9s Rojas Hern\xe1ndez, mathematics student at the Universidad Nacional de Colombia Medellin, since about 6 years ago I have learned on my own the development in python, its libraries and frameworks, something that identifies me is self-taught learning because over the years I have developed both soft skills and technical skills in the language, I am very motivated by programming and learning things every day.\\n\\n### ___About Grids for artists___\\n\\nI made this application because since my sister studies plastic arts, sometimes she has problems when it comes to making guide grids for her canvases, so I wanted to satisfy that need she had using python and the MecSimCalc tool, it is very easy to use, plus it has the main libraries, such as machine learning and image processing, in this case with Pillow, the input and output of data is very comfortable, anyone can share and create applications in record time. Awesome!\\n\\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n## **[2D Heat Equation Visualizer](https://mecsimcalc.com/app/5317027/2_d_heat_equation_visualizer)**\\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n### ___Bio: Jasper Eitzen and About 2D Heat Equation Visualizer___\\n\\nMy name is Jasper Eitzen, I\u2019m currently a graduate student at the University of Alberta, pursuing a Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering. The work I do for my thesis mostly consists of lab experiments, although I do have experience using Python to analyse experimental data as well as some programming experience from my undergrad and graduate studies. I came up with the idea for 2D Heat Equation Visualizer from having written some simple numerical solvers in the past and seeing that MecSimCalc could provide a convenient way to get inputs from the user. I thought that the results of such an app could look quite interesting since I\u2019ve done similar projects in the past, and I always found it cool to set up an initial condition and see how it evolves over time based on math and physics. With contour plots as outputs, users can play around with the app\u2019s inputs to try and get unique results. I needed quite a few inputs and the input page on MecSimCalc was very useful in letting me lay them all out and provide explanations so that the user could pick values that provide good results. As someone with no experience in web development, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to make something like this app without the interface that MecSimCalc provided.\\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n## **[LymeML](https://mecsimcalc.com/app/4663263/lyme_ml)**\\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n### ___Bio: Soham Jain___\\n\\nSoham Jain is currently a sophomore with a passion for machine learning at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, a prestigious high school that is ranked #1 in the United States. He works as a Machine Learning Engineer for a local start-up company called Vytal, where he assists in creating novel ML algorithms for fast and comprehensive neurologic and cardiac assessment through smartphone-based applications.

Outside of school, Soham likes to tutor other students, play the piano, spend time with friends, and listen to music.\\n\\n### ___About LymeML___\\n\\nLymeML is an application built on MecSimCalc that uses novel machine learning algorithms to diagnose Lyme disease, a prevalent issue in numerous countries around the world. Research suggests that 14% of the world\'s population is currently affected or has been affected in the past with Lyme disease, contributing to the significance of this issue. Contemporary methods to diagnose this disease require a blood test. with lab reports anticipated to arrive three or four weeks after the patient seeks medical attention. However, waiting several days to receive a diagnosis allows symptoms to worsen, causing detrimental and irreversible damage to the brain or heart. Soham Jain, a current high school sophomore in the United States and Machine Learning Engineer at a local startup company, noticed that this issue can be resolved through creating a machine learning algorithm that sends an effective and immediate result to the user through image classification and a self-check symptoms diagnosis. This app implements convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Python libraries such as NumPy and TensorFlow to accurately diagnose Lyme disease. Implementing this app will help several individuals living in remote areas to expedite the process of receiving a medical diagnosis, and differentiate their symptoms/rashes from those of other diseases. With the help of machine learning and MecSimCalc for making this app available to others, countless individuals will receive an instant diagnosis of Lyme disease and can treat their symptoms faster.\\n\\n### ___My experience with MecSimCalc___\\nWith the help of MecSimCalc, LymeML will continue on its mission to aid countless more individuals living in remote areas to receive an instant diagnosis for Lyme disease, and can treat their symptoms more efficiently. Through featuring LymeML as a winner for this hackathon, the opportunities for telemedicine and machine learning algorithms in the future has opened, and soon more accurate and immediate models will be created to diagnose several diseases. Creating the LymeML app through MecSimCalc was very straightforward and many Python libraries were accessible.

Maximize, has 2 inputs with their coefficients. Assembly has 3 inputs, each being its respective coefficients, and Max demand has 1 input. The coefficients are aB+ bP = cC where B is brass, P is platinum, and C is the constant, with the input [a,b,c]. The inputs are interpreted into functions where it is drawn on the graph. There will be a feasible region where all boundaries will be satisfied. The program then picks all the intersections within the feasible region(note that some points will not be accounted for). The output just gives the profits given at that point on the graph. |\\n| [Cattle Profit](https://mecsimcalc.com/app/4532115/cattle_profit) | Max Profit Estimation | An application to maximize profits (only gives boundaries), the first table consists of the first element being the regular, and the 2nd being the premium. The second table consists of the first element being alfalfa and the second being barley. This can also be translated such as the required material for a toy car to be inputted, but in this case it is just using cattle profit as the output. The program basically just gives the boundaries and conditions of what to expect before proceeding onto the next step.                                                                                                                                                                |"},{"id":"welcome","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/welcome","source":"@site/blog/2022-03-02-welcome.md","title":"Welcome to MecSimCalc","description":"Welcome to our newly released MecSimCalc platform for creating and sharing computational tools on the web.

With a few very simple steps, educators and professionals can create interactive web applications for their students or clients.\\n\\n**MecSimCalc** has been a concept in my head since I joined the Engineering Faculty at the University of Alberta in 2007. At the time, I was looking for an easy way to create interactive web examples for my students to help them visualize different Mathematical and Engineering concepts. Throughout the years, I experimented with [webMathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/products/webmathematica/) and [javascripts](https://www.javascript.com/). However, dealing with web infrastructure has always been a struggle. I still remember the agony of trying to switch my whole website from traditional HTTP to HTTPS or the yearly agony of renewing the licenses of the different components that I was using. Throughout the years, my experience has shaped my vision for creating **MecSimCalc** as a platform that frees the developer from all the ever changing web architecture to allow them to focus on their application.\\n\\n**MecSimCalc** is a simple, yet extremely powerful platform that has applications in a large array of fields. Here is an example in [Medicine](https://www.mecsimcalc.com/app/7188609/diabetes_risk), by answering a simple questionnaire, a visitor to the app can identify their diabetes risk. The app was created based on an algorithm published on a [Canadian government website](https://www.healthycanadians.gc.ca/en/canrisk). For University Mathematics [Education](https://www.mecsimcalc.com/app/4730621/numerical_integration), a student can enter any functional expression and the limits of an integral while the interactive app would calculate the numerical integral and would provide a plot, powered by `matplotlib` for visual illustration of the example.\\n\\nWe created **MecSimCalc** for professionals in engineering and finance. Consider the [app](https://www.mecsimcalc.com/app/3333910/mortgage_calculator) that can be distributed by a mortgage specialist to his or her clients to help them identify the price of the house that matches their finances. Or consider the [Engineering app](https://www.mecsimcalc.com/app/8106967/cor_las_model) that uses the [CorLAS](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309917227_Review_of_Engineering_Fracture_Mechanics_Model_for_Pipeline_Applications) algorithm to calculate the failure pressure of pipelines with longitudinal crack like features. While these apps are currently publicly available, we can work with any professionals to help them build and share their specific applications only with their clients.\\n\\nI welcome all our visitors to [explore](https://www.mecsimcalc.com/explore) the different applications that have been created using **MecSimCalc**.\\n\\nWe also invite all professionals, scientists, and educators who would like to publicly or privately publish their lively algorithms to try out our **free** platform. We promise to keep it free for any publicly available applications. We are also happy to work with any professionals wishing to use **MecSimCalc** for their enterprise applications.\\n\\nPlease send us any suggestions, questions, or inquiries to info@mecsimcalc.com"}]}')}}]);
