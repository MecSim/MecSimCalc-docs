## Building an App

Creating web applications should be a straightforward process. Let's explore how Anvil and MecSimCalc facilitate the app-building process.

### Anvil:

1. Select a template or create a new app.
2. Choose an app theme.
3. Utilize the drag-and-drop UI builder.
4. Create and customize databases.
5. Write code in server modules (requires custom Anvil functions).
6. Link server modules with the front-end.
7. Publish your app with a custom domain.

### MecSimCalc:

1. Begin building your app directly in the browser.
2. Utilize the drag-and-drop inputs editor.
3. All coding can be done in the browser.
4. Manually connect inputs to the code with Python.
5. Run your app with a single click.
6. Utilize custom Python libraries.

## Conclusion

Both Anvil and MecSimCalc aim to simplify web application development, enabling users to leverage the power of Python without the need for extensive web development experience. While Anvil is designed for building full-fledged websites and offers more features, MecSimCalc is geared towards non-technical users and simplifies complex computations.
