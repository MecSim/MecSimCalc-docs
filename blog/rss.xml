So I‚Äôm really astonished but very proud about the end result.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="about-my-app-and-why-i-made-it"><strong><em>About my app and why I made it</em></strong><a class="hash-link" href="#about-my-app-and-why-i-made-it" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h3><p>As the theme of the hackathon was creating a calculator, I was first thinking of traditional conversion calculator (like height, weight, distance, etc.) as I‚Äôm from Europe &amp; you are from North America.</p><p>Meanwhile It sounds too simple &amp; I want also to try the possibility to display some visuals (what sounds difficult with a conversion calculator).</p><p>Then comes to me this idea of Annualized RoR  with also explanation of compound interest. Also, the Annualized RoR  is really useful if you want to compare different possible investments &amp; not so straight forward to obtain by doing mental calculation (at least for me üòâ). So I can indeed rely on a tool for this calculation &amp; this can be useful for others as well so a good reason to publish on a web site.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="my-experience-with-mecsimcalc"><strong><em>My experience with MecSimCalc</em></strong><a class="hash-link" href="#my-experience-with-mecsimcalc" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h3><p>I have to say MecSimCalc is really easy to use &amp; it corresponds to my philosophy of working. Indeed, my side I prefer to work on the business logic part (backend side) of an app and  don‚Äôt want to pass too much time developing the frontend part. So having a framework proposing me a no-code approach for the presentation part meets my expectations. Your idea to have a reach text editor, a collection of input fields with pre-validation of parameter values is really great.</p><p>For the input part, I was able to very quickly present/document the app using text editor (instead of HTML or Markdown that will takes more time). The default template of presentation is good. Of course there is no possibility to have too much customization but for me, at the moment I have a default nice layout, I have no problem to stitch to it. The only issue I have seen is related to the mobile view (see more details at the end of this e-mail)</p><p>For the output part, integrating Jinja to a rich text editor instead of HTML is just awesome.</p><hr><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="black-scholes-top-5-app"><strong><a href="https://mecsimcalc.com/app/8739983/black_scholes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Black Scholes (Top 5 App)</a></strong><a class="hash-link" href="#black-scholes-top-5-app" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h2><hr><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="about-amysoj-j-a-exson-joseph"><strong><em>About Amysoj J A Exson Joseph</em></strong><a class="hash-link" href="#about-amysoj-j-a-exson-joseph" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h3><p>I am a computer science engineering student in my final year, hailing from Tamil Nadu, India.

The drag-and-drop interface for input widgets is simple to use and helped in adding or changing elements quickly.

So, to learn myself and to help others learn stats, I made this app. Stats is a very interesting subject, It can reveal many fascinating outcomes but before that you have to do some hard calculations if your data is big.

This can prove extremely useful to other university students and professors.</p><p>The app has operations like matrix multiplication, matrix inverse, row-space,column-space, and null-space calculations, QR decomposition, and eigenvector solving. You can input any 3x3 matrix into the app for any of the operations mentioned above and click "Submit" to get the answers.

I knew there was something that we use more often than we realize: the quadratic functions.
Hence, on the occasion of MecSimCalc's Hackathon 2.0, I made a Quadratic Equations Solver. As its name suggests, it solves quadratic equations in their standard form: ax¬≤ + bx + c = 0, providing you with analytical and descriptive results to help you find solutions easily.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="my-experience-with-mecsimcalc"><strong><em>My experience with MecSimCalc</em></strong><a class="hash-link" href="#my-experience-with-mecsimcalc" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h3><p>I'm so grateful for joining MecSimCalc. I've had a wonderful experience working in its coding environment. MecSimCalc solves the hard side of creating GUIs with a drag-and-drop solution. The interface is very intuitive and easy to understand. It has more features than I expected like the integration of LaTeX, geospatial utilities, handling files and processing images, etc... The best part is that you don't need prior experience in web development. You can simply create a Python web app and deploy it instantly within minutes!</p><hr><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="quality-of-life-app"><strong><a href="https://mecsimcalc.com/app/6185690/quality_of_life_app" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quality of Life App</a></strong><a class="hash-link" href="#quality-of-life-app" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h2><hr><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="about-anika-krishnan"><strong><em>About Anika Krishnan</em></strong><a class="hash-link" href="#about-anika-krishnan" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h3><p>I am a high schooler in Redmond, WA, USA.

This was the inspiration for the idea. When one moves to a city, many things are important for your quality of your life, eg.: Air Quality, Safety, Traffic, Covid Risk, Cost of Milk and Eggs, Housing costs and more.. Wouldn't it be nice to know how the city measures on all the things that are important to you? The Quality of Life app uses many sources to gather data and calculate scores in different areas like air quality, pollen, job climate so you can visualize all the data and make informed decisions.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="my-experience-with-mecsimcalc-1"><strong><em>My experience with MecSimCalc</em></strong><a class="hash-link" href="#my-experience-with-mecsimcalc-1" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h3><p>It was very easy to get started. The examples and tutorials were very helpful. It took very little time to have the triangle example working. While building the application, I really appreciated being able to write the code and test it directly in the browser and was able to build a good app with some UI during the hackathon. Things that would make this platform more powerful include being able to more during inputs ( html/js), more support for additional libraries ( maybe allow users to add). It was a bit hard to debug ( being able to step through Jupyter notebooks may be useful). Overall I really enjoyed this experience and being able to build an app with UI and inputs/outputs without having to learn about all the other systems.</p><hr><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="your-trip-buddy"><strong><a href="https://mecsimcalc.com/app/0866015/your_trip_buddy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Your Trip Buddy</a></strong><a class="hash-link" href="#your-trip-buddy" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h2><hr><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="about-vaibhav-thalanki"><strong><em>About Vaibhav Thalanki</em></strong><a class="hash-link" href="#about-vaibhav-thalanki" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h3><p>I am Vaibhav Thalanki from Chennai, India.

I thought it would be great to be able to automatically decode the relevant portions without needing to copy each one by hand.

algebra course. This app helps students better grasp how operations are performed with
complex numbers. The app lets you perform 4 types of operations: addition, subtraction,
multiplication, and division. Addition and subtraction using complex numbers is best performed
using vectors and the app walks users through the steps using visual aids. Multiplication and
division using complex numbers is best performed using euler form and the app provides
excellent visual aids to assist students in learning the step-by-step process. Learning how to
perform operations on complex numbers is very important for any engineering student.
Complex numbers have many practical applications particularly in electrical and computer
engineering where these skills will be invaluable. Students who use this app will find themselves
better prepared for their future engineering courses.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="understanding-vector-fields"><strong>Understanding Vector Fields</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#understanding-vector-fields" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h2><p>This blog post is dedicated to the <a href="https://mecsimcalc.com/app/9890961/understanding_vector_fields" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Understanding Vector Fields</a> app created by John Yu.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="about-the-app-1"><strong><em>About the app</em></strong><a class="hash-link" href="#about-the-app-1" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h3><p>The Understanding Vector Fields app lets you visually generate a vector field. The app takes in
an equation representing your vector field and plots each vector on a graph. It is useful in a
variety of applications. Vector calculus is a very important skill and many engineering students
take a calculus class dedicated to this subject. You can plot simple equations like the flow of a
river with the equation . You can plot more complicated vector fields like a magnetic field using

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The following blogposts were written by John Yu for various apps he had created on MecSimCalc. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="pairwise-testing-generator"><strong>Pairwise Testing Generator</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#pairwise-testing-generator" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h2><p>This blog post is dedicated to the <a href="https://mecsimcalc.com/app/8809236/pairwise_testing_generator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pairwise Testing Generator</a> app created by John Yu.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="about-the-pairwise-testing-generator"><strong><em>About the Pairwise Testing Generator</em></strong><a class="hash-link" href="#about-the-pairwise-testing-generator" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h3><p>The pairwise testing generator is an app that can generate a set of test cases with up to 5
independent variables. The app uses a technique called Taguchi Orthogonal Arrays such that
every pairing of variables appears in at least one test case. This method is significantly more
powerful and more efficient compared to brute-force testing. You can get full testing coverage
of your program using significantly less test cases. This can save you a lot of time and a lot of
money depending on the size of your program.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-i-made-this-app"><strong><em>Why I made this app</em></strong><a class="hash-link" href="#why-i-made-this-app" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h3><p>Software testing is a critical step in the software development lifecycle. There are countless
opportunities for mistakes and defects to come up at any point in the development of software.
Fixing code is equally as important as creating code. Finding these bugs early in the
development lifecycle will help to mitigate issues that come up later. The hard part of testing
code is generating test cases. Full code coverage often comes with a huge set of test cases
which is expensive and time consuming. A small set of test cases is cost effective but lacks code
coverage. I made this app to help software engineers generate test cases that can provide
adequate code coverage in a reasonable amount of test cases. This saves you a lot of time and
money and improves the quality of your code.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="simple-linear-regression-and-discrete-probability-distribution"><strong>Simple Linear Regression and Discrete Probability Distribution</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#simple-linear-regression-and-discrete-probability-distribution" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h2><p>This blog post is dedicated to the <a href="https://mecsimcalc.com/app/3625435/simple_linear_regression" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Simple Linear Regression</a> and <a href="https://mecsimcalc.com/app/8359657/visualizing_discrete_probability_distributions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visualizing Discrete Probability Distributions</a> apps created by John Yu.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="about-the-simple-linear-regression-and-the-discrete-probability-distribution-app"><strong><em>About the Simple Linear Regression and the Discrete Probability Distribution App</em></strong><a class="hash-link" href="#about-the-simple-linear-regression-and-the-discrete-probability-distribution-app" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h3><p>The simple linear regression app can generate a regression line from your set of data points.
The app is intended to be a helpful tool for Statistics students to understand how the linear
regression line is calculated. There are no statistical libraries used in the calculation of the
regression line. All calculations are done using equations from my statistics textbook. The app
will calculate the regression line as well as show you how the calculation is performed. In
statistics, there are many formulas that can calculate a regression line. This app uses the
simplest equation to help students gain a better understanding of how the regression line is
calculated.</p><p>The Discrete Probability Distribution app can visualize common probability distributions in
Statistics. This app is intended to be a helpful tool for students taking Statistics to understand
how these probability distributions work. The user can play around with the parameters of the
distributions defined in the app inputs to understand how these parameters impact the graph.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="truth-table-generator"><strong>Truth Table Generator</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#truth-table-generator" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h2><p>This blog post is dedicated to the <a href="https://mecsimcalc.com/app/4669459/truth_table_generator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Truth Table Generator</a> app created by John Yu.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="about-the-truth-table-generator-app"><strong><em>About the Truth Table Generator App</em></strong><a class="hash-link" href="#about-the-truth-table-generator-app" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h3><p>The truth table generator is an app that can generate a truth table by defining a logical
expression. You can define a logic expression simply by typing it into the app inputs. The app
will evaluate your expression with each possible combination of inputs and return the expected
output. This app is intended to be used by students taking a digital logic class who need to
quickly generate a truth table. Sometimes a logic expression may be very complicated to
evaluate by hand. This app can generate a truth table with any expression no matter how
complicated it is. Students will find this app by helpful for verifying your truth table. The app
has been tested multiple times to ensure that the expected outputs are correct.</p>]]></content:encoded>

I'm passionate about machine learning, bioinformatics, web development, biomedical engineering, and app development. I worked with Videet and Dorsa to create iMedic to contribute to the distribution of medical technology in areas around the world that lack accessible access. Our project was made to detect some of the fatal causes of death in these areas to provide people a way to monitor their health and take necessary action quickly. MecsimCalc allowed us to integrate our python code into an easy, aesthetic, and secure front-end system.

-compare yourself with the electricity bill of an average citizen
-compare your appliances with popular products in the same range</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-i-made-this-app"><strong><em>Why I made this app</em></strong><a class="hash-link" href="#why-i-made-this-app" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h3><p>As per a report by World Economic Forum, the end use efficiency of electricity in residential environment in USA is a mere 65%, signifying the level of wastage of energy. The waste of electricity ends up in increasing the costs for the user, while also making a carbon footprint on the environment. The application will focus on conserving electricity. The target users of this application will be all the people who use electricity in their homes.</p><p>A big proportion of people in both urban and rural areas use electrical appliances and pay the electricity bill. It is common to look at the bill and thinking how the cost can be reduced. But as there is no way of accurately understanding how, we guess on different appliances, which makes the process harder. This application solves this. Also, before getting a new electrical appliance, we will be able to estimate the total power consumption, estimate total costs, compare with average households, and recommend how the user can make the combination of electrical appliances more efficient.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="my-experience-with-mecsimcalc"><strong><em>My experience with MecSimCalc</em></strong><a class="hash-link" href="#my-experience-with-mecsimcalc" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h3><p>Compared from my previous experiences of creating web-apps, making apps here is much easier than anywhere else I have seen on the internet.

I came up with the idea for 2D Heat Equation Visualizer from having written some simple numerical solvers in the past and seeing that MecSimCalc could provide a convenient way to get inputs from the user. I thought that the results of such an app could look quite interesting since I‚Äôve done similar projects in the past, and I always found it cool to set up an initial condition and see how it evolves over time based on math and physics. With contour plots as outputs, users can play around with the app‚Äôs inputs to try and get unique results. I needed quite a few inputs and the input page on MecSimCalc was very useful in letting me lay them all out and provide explanations so that the user could pick values that provide good results. As someone with no experience in web development, I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to make something like this app without the interface that MecSimCalc provided.</p><hr><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="lymeml"><strong><a href="https://mecsimcalc.com/app/4663263/lyme_ml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LymeML</a></strong><a class="hash-link" href="#lymeml" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h2><hr><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="bio-soham-jain"><strong><em>Bio: Soham Jain</em></strong><a class="hash-link" href="#bio-soham-jain" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h3><p>Soham Jain is currently a sophomore with a passion for machine learning at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, a prestigious high school that is ranked #1 in the United States.

Research suggests that 14% of the world's population is currently affected or has been affected in the past with Lyme disease, contributing to the significance of this issue. Contemporary methods to diagnose this disease require a blood test. with lab reports anticipated to arrive three or four weeks after the patient seeks medical attention. However, waiting several days to receive a diagnosis allows symptoms to worsen, causing detrimental and irreversible damage to the brain or heart. Soham Jain, a current high school sophomore in the United States and Machine Learning Engineer at a local startup company, noticed that this issue can be resolved through creating a machine learning algorithm that sends an effective and immediate result to the user through image classification and a self-check symptoms diagnosis. This app implements convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Python libraries such as NumPy and TensorFlow to accurately diagnose Lyme disease. Implementing this app will help several individuals living in remote areas to expedite the process of receiving a medical diagnosis, and differentiate their symptoms/rashes from those of other diseases. With the help of machine learning and MecSimCalc for making this app available to others, countless individuals will receive an instant diagnosis of Lyme disease and can treat their symptoms faster.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="my-experience-with-mecsimcalc-1"><strong><em>My experience with MecSimCalc</em></strong><a class="hash-link" href="#my-experience-with-mecsimcalc-1" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h3><p>With the help of MecSimCalc, LymeML will continue on its mission to aid countless more individuals living in remote areas to receive an instant diagnosis for Lyme disease, and can treat their symptoms more efficiently. Through featuring LymeML as a winner for this hackathon, the opportunities for telemedicine and machine learning algorithms in the future has opened, and soon more accurate and immediate models will be created to diagnose several diseases. Creating the LymeML app through MecSimCalc was very straightforward and many Python libraries were accessible. The documentation and app analytics were also available, making my experience with this website more professional and enjoyable.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I‚Äôve spent the last month creating apps for the purpose of designing flexural members, compression members, tension members, and beam-columns in accordance with CSA S16-19.</p><p>First, I had to learn Python. I took a 12-hour beginners course which was sufficient for learning the basics to Python, however not specific enough to be able to code the apps and get them to function as desired. Luckily, there are plenty of resources online and through watching YouTube tutorials, I was able to code the apps. Overall, learning python required lots of trial and error but was overall a smooth process due to the available resources.</p><p>I also had a very good experience using MecSimCalc as I found it incredibly easy to use and efficient, and it did not take long to adjust to.</p><p>Five applications have been created for design calculations in accordance with CSA S16-19. All applications require an input of the Cross Section, Yield Strength, and Unbraced Length of the member. The applications and their capabilities are presented below.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Calculator</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://mecsimcalc.com/app/4389397/design_of_flexural_members_with_w_section_csa_s_16_19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Design of Flexural Members with W-Section</a></td><td>This application computes the Section Class, Plastic or Yield Flexural Moment, Factored Flexural Moment Resistance, and Factored Shear Resistance of W-Sections under uniformly distributed load. Along with the mentioned inputs, there is also a lateral support option. If the beam is laterally unsupported, the Equivalent Moment Factor and Critical Elastic Flexural Moment are also computed for the purpose of calculating the Factored Moment Resistance.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://mecsimcalc.com/app/7445336/design_of_compression_members_in_accordance_with_csa_s_16_19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Design of Compression Members</a></td><td>This application checks the Width-to-Thickness Ratio, Slenderness, and computes the Factored Compression Resistance for W-Sections and HSS. Along with the general inputs for the CSA apps, there is also the option of support conditions, which is used to determine the Effective Length Factor in the Factored Compression Resistance calculations. If the compression member does not pass the Width-to-Thickness Ratio Check, the app stops there as the predicted resistance cannot actually be reached.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://mecsimcalc.com/app/0029258/design_of_tension_members_in_accordance_with_csa_s_16_19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Design of Tension Members</a></td><td>This application calculates the Factored Tensile Resistance based on gross section yielding and performs a Serviceability Limit State (SLS) vibration check for W-Sections and HSS.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://mecsimcalc.com/app/3708352/w_shaped_beam_columns_under_major_axis_bending_csa_s_16_19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">W-Section Beam-Columns under Major Axis Bending</a></td><td>This application performs the four limit state checks for Beam-Columns with W-Sections under major axis bending.

There are restrictions on the number of bits that can be checked, due to an overflow possibility in python.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://mecsimcalc.com/app/0378917/hard_disk_drive_hdd_reading_a_file" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hard Disk Drive (HDD) Reading a File</a></td><td>Hardware Engineering</td><td>Best and random cases of the time an HDD will take to read over a file.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to our newly released <strong>MecSimCalc</strong> platform for <strong>creating</strong> and <strong>sharing</strong> computational tools on the web. With a few very simple steps, educators and professionals can create interactive web applications for their students or clients.</p><p><strong>MecSimCalc</strong> has been a concept in my head since I joined the Engineering Faculty at the University of Alberta in 2007. At the time, I was looking for an easy way to create interactive web examples for my students to help them visualize different Mathematical and Engineering concepts. Throughout the years, I experimented with <a href="https://www.wolfram.com/products/webmathematica/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">webMathematica</a> and <a href="https://www.javascript.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">javascripts</a>. However, dealing with web infrastructure has always been a struggle. I still remember the agony of trying to switch my whole website from traditional HTTP to HTTPS or the yearly agony of renewing the licenses of the different components that I was using. Throughout the years, my experience has shaped my vision for creating <strong>MecSimCalc</strong> as a platform that frees the developer from all the ever changing web architecture to allow them to focus on their application.</p><p><strong>MecSimCalc</strong> is a simple, yet extremely powerful platform that has applications in a large array of fields. Here is an example in <a href="https://www.mecsimcalc.com/app/7188609/diabetes_risk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Medicine</a>, by answering a simple questionnaire, a visitor to the app can identify their diabetes risk. The app was created based on an algorithm published on a <a href="https://www.healthycanadians.gc.ca/en/canrisk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Canadian government website</a>. For University Mathematics <a href="https://www.mecsimcalc.com/app/4730621/numerical_integration" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Education</a>, a student can enter any functional expression and the limits of an integral while the interactive app would calculate the numerical integral and would provide a plot, powered by <code>matplotlib</code> for visual illustration of the example.</p><p>We created <strong>MecSimCalc</strong> for professionals in engineering and finance. Consider the <a href="https://www.mecsimcalc.com/app/3333910/mortgage_calculator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">app</a> that can be distributed by a mortgage specialist to his or her clients to help them identify the price of the house that matches their finances. Or consider the <a href="https://www.mecsimcalc.com/app/8106967/cor_las_model" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Engineering app</a> that uses the <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309917227_Review_of_Engineering_Fracture_Mechanics_Model_for_Pipeline_Applications" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CorLAS</a> algorithm to calculate the failure pressure of pipelines with longitudinal crack like features. While these apps are currently publicly available, we can work with any professionals to help them build and share their specific applications only with their clients.</p><p>I welcome all our visitors to <a href="https://www.mecsimcalc.com/explore" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">explore</a> the different applications that have been created using <strong>MecSimCalc</strong>.</p><p>We also invite all professionals, scientists, and educators who would like to publicly or privately publish their lively algorithms to try out our <strong>free</strong> platform. We promise to keep it free for any publicly available applications. We are also happy to work with any professionals wishing to use <strong>MecSimCalc</strong> for their enterprise applications.</p><p>Please send us any suggestions, questions, or inquiries to <a href="mailto:info@mecsimcalc.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">info@mecsimcalc.com</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
