This competition sponsored by 1984 Ventures and echo3D, was aimed to showcase MecSimCalc as a platform for creating web applications in Python. The theme for this hackathon was <strong>&quot;Creating a calculator that you would use for one of your classes&quot;</strong>. Users created an app on the MecSimCalc website, tagged it as &quot;Comp01212023&quot; and published it for a chance to win $100. Throughout the competition there were 66 sign-ups and 8 submissions. This blog post is dedicated to the top 5 scoring apps from MecSimCalc&#x27;s January 21st - January 28th, 2023 Hackathon 5.0. To view all apps submitted during the competition, you can check out this collection: <a href="https://mecsimcalc.com/collection/304941d7-e854-41bf-9353-508d2c8e0cad" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hackathon 5.0 Submissions</a>.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Hackathon 5.0 Poster" src="/assets/images/Hackathon_5.0-8c52334f9de8d3e8ff68ef9fa248e5b1.png" width="1728" height="2304" class="img_ev3q"></p><table><thead><tr><th>App</th><th>Author(s)</th><th>Win</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://mecsimcalc.com/app/3050759/annualized_rate_of_return" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Annualized Rate of Return</a></td><td>Philippe Saint-Amand</td><td>Grand Prize Winner ($100)</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://mecsimcalc.com/app/8220162/offset_c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Offset-C</a></td><td>Devaraja G</td><td>Top 5 App</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://mecsimcalc.com/app/2263771/visualizer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visualizer</a></td><td>Raj Kumar</td><td>Top 5 App</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://mecsimcalc.com/app/5280055/equation_balancer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Equation Balancer</a></td><td>Pulkit Govrani</td><td>Top 5 App</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://mecsimcalc.com/app/8739983/black_scholes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Black Scholes</a></td><td>Amysoj J A Exson Joseph</td><td>Top 5 App</td></tr></tbody></table><hr><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="annualized-rate-of-return-grand-prize-winner"><strong><a href="https://mecsimcalc.com/app/3050759/annualized_rate_of_return" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Annualized Rate of Return (Grand Prize Winner)</a></strong><a href="#annualized-rate-of-return-grand-prize-winner" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to annualized-rate-of-return-grand-prize-winner" title="Direct link to annualized-rate-of-return-grand-prize-winner">​</a></h2><hr><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="philippe-saint-amand">Philippe Saint-Amand<a href="#philippe-saint-amand" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Philippe Saint-Amand" title="Direct link to Philippe Saint-Amand">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="about-me"><strong><em>About Me</em></strong><a href="#about-me" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to about-me" title="Direct link to about-me">​</a></h3><p>My name is Philippe and I live in Belgium.</p><p>I’m eager to learn and in my free time, I love playing around with Python and test libraries in various area : Data Analytics, Security, Web Development, Image processing, Geolocation/Geomapping, …</p><p>So when I saw a site where the key message is “Create and share your Python web apps in minutes for free”, I have of course to test it!</p><p>I added also an extra challenge by participating to my first hackathon. So I’m really astonished but very proud about the end result.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="about-my-app-and-why-i-made-it"><strong><em>About my app and why I made it</em></strong><a href="#about-my-app-and-why-i-made-it" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to about-my-app-and-why-i-made-it" title="Direct link to about-my-app-and-why-i-made-it">​</a></h3><p>As the theme of the hackathon was creating a calculator, I was first thinking of traditional conversion calculator (like height, weight, distance, etc.) as I’m from Europe &amp; you are from North America.</p><p>Meanwhile It sounds too simple &amp; I want also to try the possibility to display some visuals (what sounds difficult with a conversion calculator).</p><p>Then comes to me this idea of Annualized RoR  with also explanation of compound interest. Also, the Annualized RoR  is really useful if you want to compare different possible investments &amp; not so straight forward to obtain by doing mental calculation (at least for me 😉). So I can indeed rely on a tool for this calculation &amp; this can be useful for others as well so a good reason to publish on a web site.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="my-experience-with-mecsimcalc"><strong><em>My experience with MecSimCalc</em></strong><a href="#my-experience-with-mecsimcalc" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to my-experience-with-mecsimcalc" title="Direct link to my-experience-with-mecsimcalc">​</a></h3><p>I have to say MecSimCalc is really easy to use &amp; it corresponds to my philosophy of working. Indeed, my side I prefer to work on the business logic part (backend side) of an app and  don’t want to pass too much time developing the frontend part. So having a framework proposing me a no-code approach for the presentation part meets my expectations. Your idea to have a reach text editor, a collection of input fields with pre-validation of parameter values is really great.</p><p>For the input part, I was able to very quickly present/document the app using text editor (instead of HTML or Markdown that will takes more time). The default template of presentation is good. Of course there is no possibility to have too much customization but for me, at the moment I have a default nice layout, I have no problem to stitch to it. The only issue I have seen is related to the mobile view (see more details at the end of this e-mail)</p><p>For the output part, integrating Jinja to a rich text editor instead of HTML is just awesome.</p><hr><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="black-scholes-top-5-app"><strong><a href="https://mecsimcalc.com/app/8739983/black_scholes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Black Scholes (Top 5 App)</a></strong><a href="#black-scholes-top-5-app" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to black-scholes-top-5-app" title="Direct link to black-scholes-top-5-app">​</a></h2><hr><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="about-amysoj-j-a-exson-joseph"><strong><em>About Amysoj J A Exson Joseph</em></strong><a href="#about-amysoj-j-a-exson-joseph" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to about-amysoj-j-a-exson-joseph" title="Direct link to about-amysoj-j-a-exson-joseph">​</a></h3><p>I am a computer science engineering student in my final year, hailing from Tamil Nadu, India.

As a Python developer, I appreciate the ease with which I can create and share web applications with just a few clicks.

I&#x27;m a Lebanese senior high school student passionate about coding and motorsports. I started programming at 14 years old with Python. I like other tech disciplines such as Cybersecurity, Arduino, and multi-platform app development.

I knew there was something that we use more often than we realize: the quadratic functions.
Hence, on the occasion of MecSimCalc&#x27;s Hackathon 2.0, I made a Quadratic Equations Solver. As its name suggests, it solves quadratic equations in their standard form: ax² + bx + c = 0, providing you with analytical and descriptive results to help you find solutions easily.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="my-experience-with-mecsimcalc"><strong><em>My experience with MecSimCalc</em></strong><a href="#my-experience-with-mecsimcalc" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to my-experience-with-mecsimcalc" title="Direct link to my-experience-with-mecsimcalc">​</a></h3><p>I&#x27;m so grateful for joining MecSimCalc. I&#x27;ve had a wonderful experience working in its coding environment. MecSimCalc solves the hard side of creating GUIs with a drag-and-drop solution. The interface is very intuitive and easy to understand. It has more features than I expected like the integration of LaTeX, geospatial utilities, handling files and processing images, etc... The best part is that you don&#x27;t need prior experience in web development. You can simply create a Python web app and deploy it instantly within minutes!</p><hr><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="quality-of-life-app"><strong><a href="https://mecsimcalc.com/app/6185690/quality_of_life_app" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quality of Life App</a></strong><a href="#quality-of-life-app" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to quality-of-life-app" title="Direct link to quality-of-life-app">​</a></h2><hr><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="about-anika-krishnan"><strong><em>About Anika Krishnan</em></strong><a href="#about-anika-krishnan" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to about-anika-krishnan" title="Direct link to about-anika-krishnan">​</a></h3><p>I am a high schooler in Redmond, WA, USA.

This was the inspiration for the idea. When one moves to a city, many things are important for your quality of your life, eg.: Air Quality, Safety, Traffic, Covid Risk, Cost of Milk and Eggs, Housing costs and more.. Wouldn&#x27;t it be nice to know how the city measures on all the things that are important to you? The Quality of Life app uses many sources to gather data and calculate scores in different areas like air quality, pollen, job climate so you can visualize all the data and make informed decisions.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="my-experience-with-mecsimcalc-1"><strong><em>My experience with MecSimCalc</em></strong><a href="#my-experience-with-mecsimcalc-1" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to my-experience-with-mecsimcalc-1" title="Direct link to my-experience-with-mecsimcalc-1">​</a></h3><p>It was very easy to get started. The examples and tutorials were very helpful. It took very little time to have the triangle example working. While building the application, I really appreciated being able to write the code and test it directly in the browser and was able to build a good app with some UI during the hackathon. Things that would make this platform more powerful include being able to more during inputs ( html/js), more support for additional libraries ( maybe allow users to add). It was a bit hard to debug ( being able to step through Jupyter notebooks may be useful). Overall I really enjoyed this experience and being able to build an app with UI and inputs/outputs without having to learn about all the other systems.</p><hr><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="your-trip-buddy"><strong><a href="https://mecsimcalc.com/app/0866015/your_trip_buddy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Your Trip Buddy</a></strong><a href="#your-trip-buddy" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to your-trip-buddy" title="Direct link to your-trip-buddy">​</a></h2><hr><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="about-vaibhav-thalanki"><strong><em>About Vaibhav Thalanki</em></strong><a href="#about-vaibhav-thalanki" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to about-vaibhav-thalanki" title="Direct link to about-vaibhav-thalanki">​</a></h3><p>I am Vaibhav Thalanki from Chennai, India.

I thought it would be great to be able to automatically decode the relevant portions without needing to copy each one by hand.

using vectors and the app walks users through the steps using visual aids. Multiplication and
division using complex numbers is best performed using euler form and the app provides
excellent visual aids to assist students in learning the step-by-step process. Learning how to
perform operations on complex numbers is very important for any engineering student.
Complex numbers have many practical applications particularly in electrical and computer
engineering where these skills will be invaluable. Students who use this app will find themselves
better prepared for their future engineering courses.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="understanding-vector-fields"><strong>Understanding Vector Fields</strong><a href="#understanding-vector-fields" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to understanding-vector-fields" title="Direct link to understanding-vector-fields">​</a></h2><p>This blog post is dedicated to the <a href="https://mecsimcalc.com/app/9890961/understanding_vector_fields" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Understanding Vector Fields</a> app created by John Yu.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="about-the-app-1"><strong><em>About the app</em></strong><a href="#about-the-app-1" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to about-the-app-1" title="Direct link to about-the-app-1">​</a></h3><p>The Understanding Vector Fields app lets you visually generate a vector field.

independent variables. The app uses a technique called Taguchi Orthogonal Arrays such that
every pairing of variables appears in at least one test case. This method is significantly more
powerful and more efficient compared to brute-force testing. You can get full testing coverage
of your program using significantly less test cases. This can save you a lot of time and a lot of
money depending on the size of your program.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-i-made-this-app"><strong><em>Why I made this app</em></strong><a href="#why-i-made-this-app" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to why-i-made-this-app" title="Direct link to why-i-made-this-app">​</a></h3><p>Software testing is a critical step in the software development lifecycle. There are countless
opportunities for mistakes and defects to come up at any point in the development of software.
Fixing code is equally as important as creating code. Finding these bugs early in the
development lifecycle will help to mitigate issues that come up later. The hard part of testing
code is generating test cases. Full code coverage often comes with a huge set of test cases
which is expensive and time consuming. A small set of test cases is cost effective but lacks code
coverage. I made this app to help software engineers generate test cases that can provide
adequate code coverage in a reasonable amount of test cases. This saves you a lot of time and
money and improves the quality of your code.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="simple-linear-regression-and-discrete-probability-distribution"><strong>Simple Linear Regression and Discrete Probability Distribution</strong><a href="#simple-linear-regression-and-discrete-probability-distribution" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to simple-linear-regression-and-discrete-probability-distribution" title="Direct link to simple-linear-regression-and-discrete-probability-distribution">​</a></h2><p>This blog post is dedicated to the <a href="https://mecsimcalc.com/app/3625435/simple_linear_regression" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Simple Linear Regression</a> and <a href="https://mecsimcalc.com/app/8359657/visualizing_discrete_probability_distributions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visualizing Discrete Probability Distributions</a> apps created by John Yu.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="about-the-simple-linear-regression-and-the-discrete-probability-distribution-app"><strong><em>About the Simple Linear Regression and the Discrete Probability Distribution App</em></strong><a href="#about-the-simple-linear-regression-and-the-discrete-probability-distribution-app" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to about-the-simple-linear-regression-and-the-discrete-probability-distribution-app" title="Direct link to about-the-simple-linear-regression-and-the-discrete-probability-distribution-app">​</a></h3><p>The simple linear regression app can generate a regression line from your set of data points.

The work I do for my thesis mostly consists of lab experiments, although I do have experience using Python to analyse experimental data as well as some programming experience from my undergrad and graduate studies. I came up with the idea for 2D Heat Equation Visualizer from having written some simple numerical solvers in the past and seeing that MecSimCalc could provide a convenient way to get inputs from the user. I thought that the results of such an app could look quite interesting since I’ve done similar projects in the past, and I always found it cool to set up an initial condition and see how it evolves over time based on math and physics. With contour plots as outputs, users can play around with the app’s inputs to try and get unique results. I needed quite a few inputs and the input page on MecSimCalc was very useful in letting me lay them all out and provide explanations so that the user could pick values that provide good results. As someone with no experience in web development, I wouldn’t have been able to make something like this app without the interface that MecSimCalc provided.</p><hr><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="lymeml"><strong><a href="https://mecsimcalc.com/app/4663263/lyme_ml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LymeML</a></strong><a href="#lymeml" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to lymeml" title="Direct link to lymeml">​</a></h2><hr><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="bio-soham-jain"><strong><em>Bio: Soham Jain</em></strong><a href="#bio-soham-jain" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to bio-soham-jain" title="Direct link to bio-soham-jain">​</a></h3><p>Soham Jain is currently a sophomore with a passion for machine learning at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, a prestigious high school that is ranked #1 in the United States.

Research suggests that 14% of the world&#x27;s population is currently affected or has been affected in the past with Lyme disease, contributing to the significance of this issue. Contemporary methods to diagnose this disease require a blood test. with lab reports anticipated to arrive three or four weeks after the patient seeks medical attention. However, waiting several days to receive a diagnosis allows symptoms to worsen, causing detrimental and irreversible damage to the brain or heart. Soham Jain, a current high school sophomore in the United States and Machine Learning Engineer at a local startup company, noticed that this issue can be resolved through creating a machine learning algorithm that sends an effective and immediate result to the user through image classification and a self-check symptoms diagnosis. This app implements convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Python libraries such as NumPy and TensorFlow to accurately diagnose Lyme disease. Implementing this app will help several individuals living in remote areas to expedite the process of receiving a medical diagnosis, and differentiate their symptoms/rashes from those of other diseases. With the help of machine learning and MecSimCalc for making this app available to others, countless individuals will receive an instant diagnosis of Lyme disease and can treat their symptoms faster.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="my-experience-with-mecsimcalc-1"><strong><em>My experience with MecSimCalc</em></strong><a href="#my-experience-with-mecsimcalc-1" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to my-experience-with-mecsimcalc-1" title="Direct link to my-experience-with-mecsimcalc-1">​</a></h3><p>With the help of MecSimCalc, LymeML will continue on its mission to aid countless more individuals living in remote areas to receive an instant diagnosis for Lyme disease, and can treat their symptoms more efficiently.

With a few very simple steps, educators and professionals can create interactive web applications for their students or clients.</p><p><strong>MecSimCalc</strong> has been a concept in my head since I joined the Engineering Faculty at the University of Alberta in 2007. At the time, I was looking for an easy way to create interactive web examples for my students to help them visualize different Mathematical and Engineering concepts. Throughout the years, I experimented with <a href="https://www.wolfram.com/products/webmathematica/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">webMathematica</a> and <a href="https://www.javascript.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">javascripts</a>. However, dealing with web infrastructure has always been a struggle. I still remember the agony of trying to switch my whole website from traditional HTTP to HTTPS or the yearly agony of renewing the licenses of the different components that I was using. Throughout the years, my experience has shaped my vision for creating <strong>MecSimCalc</strong> as a platform that frees the developer from all the ever changing web architecture to allow them to focus on their application.</p><p><strong>MecSimCalc</strong> is a simple, yet extremely powerful platform that has applications in a large array of fields. Here is an example in <a href="https://www.mecsimcalc.com/app/7188609/diabetes_risk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Medicine</a>, by answering a simple questionnaire, a visitor to the app can identify their diabetes risk. The app was created based on an algorithm published on a <a href="https://www.healthycanadians.gc.ca/en/canrisk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Canadian government website</a>. For University Mathematics <a href="https://www.mecsimcalc.com/app/4730621/numerical_integration" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Education</a>, a student can enter any functional expression and the limits of an integral while the interactive app would calculate the numerical integral and would provide a plot, powered by <code>matplotlib</code> for visual illustration of the example.</p><p>We created <strong>MecSimCalc</strong> for professionals in engineering and finance. Consider the <a href="https://www.mecsimcalc.com/app/3333910/mortgage_calculator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">app</a> that can be distributed by a mortgage specialist to his or her clients to help them identify the price of the house that matches their finances. Or consider the <a href="https://www.mecsimcalc.com/app/8106967/cor_las_model" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Engineering app</a> that uses the <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309917227_Review_of_Engineering_Fracture_Mechanics_Model_for_Pipeline_Applications" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CorLAS</a> algorithm to calculate the failure pressure of pipelines with longitudinal crack like features. While these apps are currently publicly available, we can work with any professionals to help them build and share their specific applications only with their clients.</p><p>I welcome all our visitors to <a href="https://www.mecsimcalc.com/explore" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">explore</a> the different applications that have been created using <strong>MecSimCalc</strong>.</p><p>We also invite all professionals, scientists, and educators who would like to publicly or privately publish their lively algorithms to try out our <strong>free</strong> platform. We promise to keep it free for any publicly available applications. We are also happy to work with any professionals wishing to use <strong>MecSimCalc</strong> for their enterprise applications.</p><p>Please send us any suggestions, questions, or inquiries to <a href="mailto:info@mecsimcalc.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">info@mecsimcalc.com</a></p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/mec-sim-calc">MecSimCalc</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><div id="discourse-comments" style="margin-top:50px"></div><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Blog list page navigation"></nav></main></div></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Links</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://mecsimcalc.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">MecSimCalc<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/MecSim/MecSimCalc-docs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">GitHub<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://twitter.com/MecSimCalc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Twitter<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">More</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/">Docs</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/blog">Blog</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="mailto:info@mecsimcalc.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Email<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Legal</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://mecsimcalc.com/legal/terms-of-service" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Terms of Service<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://mecsimcalc.com/legal/privacy-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Privacy Policy<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © MecSimCalc 2023</div></div></div></footer></div>
