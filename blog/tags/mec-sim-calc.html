independent variables. The app uses a technique called Taguchi Orthogonal Arrays such that
every pairing of variables appears in at least one test case. This method is significantly more
powerful and more efficient compared to brute-force testing. You can get full testing coverage
of your program using significantly less test cases. This can save you a lot of time and a lot of
money depending on the size of your program.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-i-made-this-app"><strong><em>Why I made this app</em></strong><a class="hash-link" href="#why-i-made-this-app" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Software testing is a critical step in the software development lifecycle. There are countless
opportunities for mistakes and defects to come up at any point in the development of software.
Fixing code is equally as important as creating code. Finding these bugs early in the
development lifecycle will help to mitigate issues that come up later. The hard part of testing
code is generating test cases. Full code coverage often comes with a huge set of test cases
which is expensive and time consuming. A small set of test cases is cost effective but lacks code
coverage. I made this app to help software engineers generate test cases that can provide
adequate code coverage in a reasonable amount of test cases. This saves you a lot of time and
money and improves the quality of your code.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="simple-linear-regression-and-discrete-probability-distribution"><strong>Simple Linear Regression and Discrete Probability Distribution</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#simple-linear-regression-and-discrete-probability-distribution" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>This blog post is dedicated to the <a href="https://mecsimcalc.com/app/3625435/simple_linear_regression" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Simple Linear Regression</a> and <a href="https://mecsimcalc.com/app/8359657/visualizing_discrete_probability_distributions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visualizing Discrete Probability Distributions</a> apps created by John Yu.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="about-the-simple-linear-regression-and-the-discrete-probability-distribution-app"><strong><em>About the Simple Linear Regression and the Discrete Probability Distribution App</em></strong><a class="hash-link" href="#about-the-simple-linear-regression-and-the-discrete-probability-distribution-app" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The simple linear regression app can generate a regression line from your set of data points.
The app is intended to be a helpful tool for Statistics students to understand how the linear
regression line is calculated. There are no statistical libraries used in the calculation of the
regression line. All calculations are done using equations from my statistics textbook. The app
will calculate the regression line as well as show you how the calculation is performed. In
statistics, there are many formulas that can calculate a regression line. This app uses the
simplest equation to help students gain a better understanding of how the regression line is
calculated.</p><p>The Discrete Probability Distribution app can visualize common probability distributions in
Statistics. This app is intended to be a helpful tool for students taking Statistics to understand
how these probability distributions work. The user can play around with the parameters of the
distributions defined in the app inputs to understand how these parameters impact the graph.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="truth-table-generator"><strong>Truth Table Generator</strong><a class="hash-link" href="#truth-table-generator" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>This blog post is dedicated to the <a href="https://mecsimcalc.com/app/4669459/truth_table_generator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Truth Table Generator</a> app created by John Yu.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="about-the-truth-table-generator-app"><strong><em>About the Truth Table Generator App</em></strong><a class="hash-link" href="#about-the-truth-table-generator-app" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The truth table generator is an app that can generate a truth table by defining a logical
expression. You can define a logic expression simply by typing it into the app inputs. The app
will evaluate your expression with each possible combination of inputs and return the expected
output. This app is intended to be used by students taking a digital logic class who need to
quickly generate a truth table. Sometimes a logic expression may be very complicated to
evaluate by hand. This app can generate a truth table with any expression no matter how
complicated it is. Students will find this app by helpful for verifying your truth table. The app
has been tested multiple times to ensure that the expected outputs are correct.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/mec-sim-calc">MecSimCalc</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/computer-science">Computer Science</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/engineering">Engineering</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/math">Math</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/statistics">Statistics</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><div id="discourse-comments" style="margin-top:50px"></div><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/Comp07092022-Winners">MecSimCalc Build-A-Thon (July 9th - July 16th, 2022) Winners</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2022-07-18T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">July 18, 2022</time> · <!-- -->11 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/daren-trinh-3816b0187/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Daren Trinh</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">University Researcher</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>MecSimCalc had it&#x27;s first ever hackathon in July 2022. This competition sponsored by 1984 Ventures, was aimed to increase the number of users and showcase the versatility of the platform. Users would create an app on the MecSimCalc website, tag it as &quot;Comp07092022&quot; and publish it for a chance to win up $500. $400 would be given to the app with the highest score and $100 would be given to the most viewed app. However, since we had received so many high quality submissions, three additional bonus prizes were given out to apps that had not won but were innovative uses of the platform. Throughout the competition there were 77 sign-ups and 13 submissions. This blog post is dedicated to the top 5 scoring apps from MecSimCalc&#x27;s July 9th - July 16th, 2022 Build-A-Thon.

Indeed, across the continuum of care, the execution of ethical medical examination is of high precedence. In her spare time, she enjoys challenging herself, as well as performing the cello with her local string orchestra. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="bio-vidheet-mehta"><strong><em>Bio: Vidheet Mehta</em></strong><a class="hash-link" href="#bio-vidheet-mehta" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Videet Mehta is a rising Junior at Dulles High School in Sugar Land Texas. He is passionate about both medicine and technology. For the last four years, he has built robots that have been placed at the top of the First Tech Challenge state and world championships. He also does competitive programming and is currently in the silver division of the USACO competition. He learned python and ML just over a year ago. And since then, he has created many medically related machine learning projects. Additionally, he is the co-founder of two ed-tech companies: Project SUCCEED (<a href="https://projectsucceed.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">projectsucceed.org</a>) and Xceleration (<a href="https://xceleration.org/dl/welcome" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">xceleration.org</a>). </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="bio-zarik-khan"><strong><em>Bio: Zarik Khan</em></strong><a class="hash-link" href="#bio-zarik-khan" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Hi, I&#x27;m Zarik Khan and I&#x27;m a rising junior at Dulles High School. I&#x27;m passionate about machine learning, bioinformatics, web development, biomedical engineering, and app development. I worked with Videet and Dorsa to create iMedic to contribute to the distribution of medical technology in areas around the world that lack accessible access. Our project was made to detect some of the fatal causes of death in these areas to provide people a way to monitor their health and take necessary action quickly. MecsimCalc allowed us to integrate our python code into an easy, aesthetic, and secure front-end system. We hope to innovate on our current project by improving the accuracy of our calculations, expanding our app&#x27;s reach, and developing new features. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="about-imedic"><strong><em>About iMedic</em></strong><a class="hash-link" href="#about-imedic" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>From the detection of infectious, cancerous, and cardiovascular diseases using a variety of means; to academic tools such as 3D computations of Chaos Theory, iMedic is a multipurpose platform that uses ML, AI, libraries, and big data. As an app created for Third World countries &amp; rural areas, it is for individuals who do not have access to medical support nor fast and efficient examination. iMedic is designed to be used frequently to evaluate one&#x27;s risks for the most common medical conditions, and to provide users with knowledge of their current health. In addition, iMedic includes cutting-edge tools for research. By including a chaos calculator—that computes &amp; graphs chaotic systems such as the Lorenz Attractor &amp; Logistic Map with yielded data via input—iMedic has many applications to fields extending far beyond medicine, such as data science, math, and CS as well.</p><hr><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="javelin-power-saver"><strong><a href="https://mecsimcalc.com/app/1569496/javelin_power_saver_cuts_your_electricity_bill_smartly" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Javelin Power Saver</a></strong><a class="hash-link" href="#javelin-power-saver" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><hr><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="bio-chetan-tyagi"><strong><em>Bio: Chetan Tyagi</em></strong><a class="hash-link" href="#bio-chetan-tyagi" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>I am Chetan Tyagi, who will be joining University of Alberta for the undergraduate in Computing Science this fall, and is very keen to learn new things about the subject and keep up to date with the latest technologies.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="about-javelin-power-saver"><strong><em>About Javelin Power Saver</em></strong><a class="hash-link" href="#about-javelin-power-saver" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>My app is called &quot;Javelin Power Saver&quot;.

The waste of electricity ends up in increasing the costs for the user, while also making a carbon footprint on the environment. The application will focus on conserving electricity. The target users of this application will be all the people who use electricity in their homes.</p><p>A big proportion of people in both urban and rural areas use electrical appliances and pay the electricity bill. It is common to look at the bill and thinking how the cost can be reduced. But as there is no way of accurately understanding how, we guess on different appliances, which makes the process harder. This application solves this. Also, before getting a new electrical appliance, we will be able to estimate the total power consumption, estimate total costs, compare with average households, and recommend how the user can make the combination of electrical appliances more efficient.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="my-experience-with-mecsimcalc"><strong><em>My experience with MecSimCalc</em></strong><a class="hash-link" href="#my-experience-with-mecsimcalc" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Compared from my previous experiences of creating web-apps, making apps here is much easier than anywhere else I have seen on the internet.

I came up with the idea for 2D Heat Equation Visualizer from having written some simple numerical solvers in the past and seeing that MecSimCalc could provide a convenient way to get inputs from the user. I thought that the results of such an app could look quite interesting since I’ve done similar projects in the past, and I always found it cool to set up an initial condition and see how it evolves over time based on math and physics. With contour plots as outputs, users can play around with the app’s inputs to try and get unique results. I needed quite a few inputs and the input page on MecSimCalc was very useful in letting me lay them all out and provide explanations so that the user could pick values that provide good results. As someone with no experience in web development, I wouldn’t have been able to make something like this app without the interface that MecSimCalc provided.</p><hr><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="lymeml"><strong><a href="https://mecsimcalc.com/app/4663263/lyme_ml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LymeML</a></strong><a class="hash-link" href="#lymeml" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><hr><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="bio-soham-jain"><strong><em>Bio: Soham Jain</em></strong><a class="hash-link" href="#bio-soham-jain" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Soham Jain is currently a sophomore with a passion for machine learning at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, a prestigious high school that is ranked #1 in the United States.

Research suggests that 14% of the world&#x27;s population is currently affected or has been affected in the past with Lyme disease, contributing to the significance of this issue. Contemporary methods to diagnose this disease require a blood test. with lab reports anticipated to arrive three or four weeks after the patient seeks medical attention. However, waiting several days to receive a diagnosis allows symptoms to worsen, causing detrimental and irreversible damage to the brain or heart. Soham Jain, a current high school sophomore in the United States and Machine Learning Engineer at a local startup company, noticed that this issue can be resolved through creating a machine learning algorithm that sends an effective and immediate result to the user through image classification and a self-check symptoms diagnosis. This app implements convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Python libraries such as NumPy and TensorFlow to accurately diagnose Lyme disease. Implementing this app will help several individuals living in remote areas to expedite the process of receiving a medical diagnosis, and differentiate their symptoms/rashes from those of other diseases. With the help of machine learning and MecSimCalc for making this app available to others, countless individuals will receive an instant diagnosis of Lyme disease and can treat their symptoms faster.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="my-experience-with-mecsimcalc-1"><strong><em>My experience with MecSimCalc</em></strong><a class="hash-link" href="#my-experience-with-mecsimcalc-1" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>With the help of MecSimCalc, LymeML will continue on its mission to aid countless more individuals living in remote areas to receive an instant diagnosis for Lyme disease, and can treat their symptoms more efficiently.

With a few very simple steps, educators and professionals can create interactive web applications for their students or clients.</p><p><strong>MecSimCalc</strong> has been a concept in my head since I joined the Engineering Faculty at the University of Alberta in 2007. At the time, I was looking for an easy way to create interactive web examples for my students to help them visualize different Mathematical and Engineering concepts. Throughout the years, I experimented with <a href="https://www.wolfram.com/products/webmathematica/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">webMathematica</a> and <a href="https://www.javascript.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">javascripts</a>. However, dealing with web infrastructure has always been a struggle. I still remember the agony of trying to switch my whole website from traditional HTTP to HTTPS or the yearly agony of renewing the licenses of the different components that I was using. Throughout the years, my experience has shaped my vision for creating <strong>MecSimCalc</strong> as a platform that frees the developer from all the ever changing web architecture to allow them to focus on their application.</p><p><strong>MecSimCalc</strong> is a simple, yet extremely powerful platform that has applications in a large array of fields. Here is an example in <a href="https://www.mecsimcalc.com/app/7188609/diabetes_risk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Medicine</a>, by answering a simple questionnaire, a visitor to the app can identify their diabetes risk. The app was created based on an algorithm published on a <a href="https://www.healthycanadians.gc.ca/en/canrisk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Canadian government website</a>. For University Mathematics <a href="https://www.mecsimcalc.com/app/4730621/numerical_integration" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Education</a>, a student can enter any functional expression and the limits of an integral while the interactive app would calculate the numerical integral and would provide a plot, powered by <code>matplotlib</code> for visual illustration of the example.</p><p>We created <strong>MecSimCalc</strong> for professionals in engineering and finance. Consider the <a href="https://www.mecsimcalc.com/app/3333910/mortgage_calculator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">app</a> that can be distributed by a mortgage specialist to his or her clients to help them identify the price of the house that matches their finances. Or consider the <a href="https://www.mecsimcalc.com/app/8106967/cor_las_model" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Engineering app</a> that uses the <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309917227_Review_of_Engineering_Fracture_Mechanics_Model_for_Pipeline_Applications" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CorLAS</a> algorithm to calculate the failure pressure of pipelines with longitudinal crack like features. While these apps are currently publicly available, we can work with any professionals to help them build and share their specific applications only with their clients.</p><p>I welcome all our visitors to <a href="https://www.mecsimcalc.com/explore" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">explore</a> the different applications that have been created using <strong>MecSimCalc</strong>.</p><p>We also invite all professionals, scientists, and educators who would like to publicly or privately publish their lively algorithms to try out our <strong>free</strong> platform. We promise to keep it free for any publicly available applications. We are also happy to work with any professionals wishing to use <strong>MecSimCalc</strong> for their enterprise applications.</p><p>Please send us any suggestions, questions, or inquiries to <a href="mailto:info@mecsimcalc.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">info@mecsimcalc.com</a></p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/mec-sim-calc">MecSimCalc</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><div id="discourse-comments" style="margin-top:50px"></div><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Blog list page navigation"></nav></main></div></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Links</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://mecsimcalc.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">MecSimCalc<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/MecSim/MecSimCalc-docs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">GitHub<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://twitter.com/MecSimCalc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Twitter<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">More</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/">Docs</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/blog">Blog</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="mailto:info@mecsimcalc.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Email<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Legal</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://mecsimcalc.com/legal/terms-of-service" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Terms of Service<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://mecsimcalc.com/legal/privacy-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Privacy Policy<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © MecSimCalc 2022</div></div></div></footer></div>
