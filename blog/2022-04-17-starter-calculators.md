| [Antique Lamps](https://mecsimcalc.com/app/6285257/antique_lamps) | Max Profit Estimation | An application to maximize profits, with the given types of lamps, bass, and platinum. Maximize, has 2 inputs with their coefficients. Assembly has 3 inputs, each being its respective coefficients, and Max demand has 1 input. The coefficients are aB+ bP = cC where B is brass, P is platinum, and C is the constant, with the input [a,b,c]. The inputs are interpreted into functions where it is drawn on the graph. There will be a feasible region where all boundaries will be satisfied. The program then picks all the intersections within the feasible region(note that some points will not be accounted for). The output just gives the profits given at that point on the graph. |
| [Cattle Profit](https://mecsimcalc.com/app/4532115/cattle_profit) | Max Profit Estimation | An application to maximize profits (only gives boundaries), the first table consists of the first element being the regular, and the 2nd being the premium. The second table consists of the first element being alfalfa and the second being barley. This can also be translated such as the required material for a toy car to be inputted, but in this case it is just using cattle profit as the output. The program basically just gives the boundaries and conditions of what to expect before proceeding onto the next step.                                                                                                                                                                |
