        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve spent the last month creating apps for the purpose of designing flexural members, compression members, tension members, and beam-columns in accordance with CSA S16-19.</p><p>First, I had to learn Python. I took a 12-hour beginners course which was sufficient for learning the basics to Python, however not specific enough to be able to code the apps and get them to function as desired. Luckily, there are plenty of resources online and through watching YouTube tutorials, I was able to code the apps. Overall, learning python required lots of trial and error but was overall a smooth process due to the available resources.</p><p>I also had a very good experience using MecSimCalc as I found it incredibly easy to use and efficient, and it did not take long to adjust to.</p><p>Five applications have been created for design calculations in accordance with CSA S16-19. All applications require an input of the Cross Section, Yield Strength, and Unbraced Length of the member. The applications and their capabilities are presented below.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Calculator</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://mecsimcalc.com/app/4389397/design_of_flexural_members_with_w_section_csa_s_16_19">Design of Flexural Members with W-Section</a></td><td>This application computes the Section Class, Plastic or Yield Flexural Moment, Factored Flexural Moment Resistance, and Factored Shear Resistance of W-Sections under uniformly distributed load. Along with the mentioned inputs, there is also a lateral support option. If the beam is laterally unsupported, the Equivalent Moment Factor and Critical Elastic Flexural Moment are also computed for the purpose of calculating the Factored Moment Resistance.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://mecsimcalc.com/app/7445336/design_of_compression_members_in_accordance_with_csa_s_16_19">Design of Compression Members</a></td><td>This application checks the Width-to-Thickness Ratio, Slenderness, and computes the Factored Compression Resistance for W-Sections and HSS. Along with the general inputs for the CSA apps, there is also the option of support conditions, which is used to determine the Effective Length Factor in the Factored Compression Resistance calculations. If the compression member does not pass the Width-to-Thickness Ratio Check, the app stops there as the predicted resistance cannot actually be reached.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://mecsimcalc.com/app/0029258/design_of_tension_members_in_accordance_with_csa_s_16_19">Design of Tension Members</a></td><td>This application calculates the Factored Tensile Resistance based on gross section yielding and performs a Serviceability Limit State (SLS) vibration check for W-Sections and HSS.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://mecsimcalc.com/app/3708352/w_shaped_beam_columns_under_major_axis_bending_csa_s_16_19">W-Section Beam-Columns under Major Axis Bending</a></td><td>This application performs the four limit state checks for Beam-Columns with W-Sections under major axis bending. Along with the general inputs, the app requires the user to input the Factored Compression Load, Smaller End Factored Moment, Larger End Factored Moment, Frame Type, and Moment Distribution. The four limit states that are checked are: Cross-Sectional Strength, Overall Member Strength, Lateral-Torsional Buckling Strength, and Moment Check.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://mecsimcalc.com/app/6568576/w_shaped_beam_columns_under_biaxial_bending_csa_s_16_19">W-Section Beam-Columns under Biaxial Bending</a></td><td>This application performs the four limit state checks for Beam-Columns with W-Sections under biaxial bending. The inputs and outputs are similar to the app for Beam-Columns under major axis bending.</td></tr></tbody></table>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to our newly released <strong>MecSimCalc</strong> platform for <strong>creating</strong> and <strong>sharing</strong> computational tools on the web. With a few very simple steps, educators and professionals can create interactive web applications for their students or clients.</p><p><strong>MecSimCalc</strong> has been a concept in my head since I joined the Engineering Faculty at the University of Alberta in 2007. At the time, I was looking for an easy way to create interactive web examples for my students to help them visualize different Mathematical and Engineering concepts. Throughout the years, I experimented with <a href="https://www.wolfram.com/products/webmathematica/">webMathematica</a> and <a href="https://www.javascript.com/">javascripts</a>. However, dealing with web infrastructure has always been a struggle. I still remember the agony of trying to switch my whole website from traditional HTTP to HTTPS or the yearly agony of renewing the licenses of the different components that I was using. Throughout the years, my experience has shaped my vision for creating <strong>MecSimCalc</strong> as a platform that frees the developer from all the ever changing web architecture to allow them to focus on their application.</p><p><strong>MecSimCalc</strong> is a simple, yet extremely powerful platform that has applications in a large array of fields. Here is an example in <a href="https://www.mecsimcalc.com/app/7188609/diabetes_risk">Medicine</a>, by answering a simple questionnaire, a visitor to the app can identify their diabetes risk. The app was created based on an algorithm published on a <a href="https://www.healthycanadians.gc.ca/en/canrisk">Canadian government website</a>. For University Mathematics <a href="https://www.mecsimcalc.com/app/4730621/numerical_integration">Education</a>, a student can enter any functional expression and the limits of an integral while the interactive app would calculate the numerical integral and would provide a plot, powered by <code>matplotlib</code> for visual illustration of the example.</p><p>We created <strong>MecSimCalc</strong> for professionals in engineering and finance. Consider the <a href="https://www.mecsimcalc.com/app/3333910/mortgage_calculator">app</a> that can be distributed by a mortgage specialist to his or her clients to help them identify the price of the house that matches their finances. Or consider the <a href="https://www.mecsimcalc.com/app/8106967/cor_las_model">Engineering app</a> that uses the <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309917227_Review_of_Engineering_Fracture_Mechanics_Model_for_Pipeline_Applications">CorLAS</a> algorithm to calculate the failure pressure of pipelines with longitudinal crack like features. While these apps are currently publicly available, we can work with any professionals to help them build and share their specific applications only with their clients.</p><p>I welcome all our visitors to <a href="https://www.mecsimcalc.com/explore">explore</a> the different applications that have been created using <strong>MecSimCalc</strong>.</p><p>We also invite all professionals, scientists, and educators who would like to publicly or privately publish their lively algorithms to try out our <strong>free</strong> platform. We promise to keep it free for any publicly available applications. We are also happy to work with any professionals wishing to use <strong>MecSimCalc</strong> for their enterprise applications.</p><p>Please send us any suggestions, questions, or inquiries to <a href="mailto:info@mecsimcalc.com">info@mecsimcalc.com</a></p>]]></content>
